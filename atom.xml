Without any further ado, let’s take a look.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP"></a>Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP</h4><p>This is, of course, the first thing that you need to do. Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro"></a>Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro</h4><p>That’s the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.</p><ul><li>First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Synchronize clips in FCP "                ></p><ul><li>Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on <strong>Balance Color</strong> and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-clips-in-fcp-2.png"                      alt="adjust youtube video scale and position"                ></p><ul><li>You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly"><a href="#Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly"></a>Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-to-youtube-from-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Upload video to YouTube from FCP"                ></p><p>This one is rather easy. Here is the sequence that you need to do. Go to File -&gt; Share -&gt; Master File -&gt; Setting -&gt; File -&gt; Share -&gt; YouTube. That’s basically it. Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -&gt; Publish and the entire thing is done. That’s all you need to do in order to quickly and conveniently upload your video to YouTube directly from the FCP.</p><p>Check this video tutorial to see how YouTube creators edit their YouTubes videos with Final Cut Pro</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-unlock-the-secret-of-youtube-to-gif-conversion-begin-here/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlock the Secret of YouTube-to-GIF Conversion -

Subtitles are useful to viewers who have hearing impairments, whose first language is different from yours, or who are unable to watch your video with sound. Closed captioning can also be useful for you as a YouTuber because it helps with your SEO, or search engine optimization. Practicing better SEO can get your videos ranked higher in search results. Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.</p><p>This article will first explain how you can turn on subtitles for the videos you watch and then walk you through adding captions to your own videos.</p><h2 id="How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How To Turn On Captions on YouTube"></a>How To Turn On Captions on YouTube</h2><p>In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG"                      alt="captions"                ></p><p>To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.</p><p>If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and selecting <strong>Playback</strong>. Check the box next to <strong>Always Show Captions</strong>, and then check   <strong>Show Automatic Captions by Speech Recognition</strong>. These captions may be flawed, but you will still be able to see the more accurate user submitted captions on videos that have them. The <strong>Always Show Captions</strong> feature may be useful not only to the hearing impaired, but to users who do not speak the same language as the video producer.</p><p>If you want to change the language of the subtitles click on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) next to the closed captioning icon and choose your language next to   <strong>Subtitles&#x2F;CC</strong> . If the language you want is not there select <strong>Auto-Translate</strong>  and then pick a language. Google Translate will be used to generate subtitles in your chosen language.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016129/19272" target="_top" id="2016129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016129/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps"><a href="#Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps"></a>Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to <strong>Video Manager</strong> in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> and then look at your videos. Decide which one you want to add captions to.</p><p>2. Click on the drop-down menu next to the video you want to add captions to and choose <strong>Subtitles and CC</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Add New</strong> <strong>Subtitles or CC</strong>.</p><p>4. Choose whether to create your captions, upload a file that has them, transcribe your video, use automatic captioning, or use captioning software.</p><p><strong>Create Subtitles or Closed Captions</strong> will allow you to create your subtitles on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Upload A File</strong> allows you to upload a pre-made subtitle file from your computer. Supported file types include SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sbv). You cannot use a word or PDF document for your subtitles.</p><p><strong>Transcribe and Set Timings</strong> is where you can type a transcript of your video and set timings to sync it to your video. This differs from Create Subtitles or Closed Captions in that your transcript is all typed in to one text field.</p><p><strong>Use Automatic Captioning</strong> will automatically use speech recognition technology to create captions. You can edit these auto-generated captions later if there are mistakes.</p><p><strong>Use Captioning Software or Services</strong> is what you choose if you want to use a program or service to create the subtitles for your video.</p><p>The easiest way to add subtitles to your videos is to use <strong>Automatic Captioning</strong>. However, Automatic Captioning is imperfect and may result in your viewers getting a sloppy, skewed, interpretation of your video. Automatic captions are also not indexed by YouTube and Google the way subtitles you create or upload are. This means that they will not have any value to your SEO strategy. If you do not input your own captions or transcript you are missing out on an opportunity for better search engine rankings. Automatic Captions are great if you do not have time to input subtitles and need a temporary solution, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082527/7443" target="_top" id="2082527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082527/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-crafting-perfect-youtube-introend-videos-at-no-cost/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Crafting Perfect YouTube Intro/End Videos at No Cost</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/reating-a-singular-stream-from-diverse-youtube-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Creating a Singular Stream From Diverse YouTube Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/utting-edge-content-summit-for-2024/"><u>[New] Cutting-Edge Content Summit for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-essential-racing-games-the-ultimate-5-list-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Racing Games The Ultimate 5-List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-perfecting-your-look-essential-makeup-tips-and-product-reviews/"><u>[New] In 2024, Perfecting Your Look Essential Makeup Tips & Product Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-decoding-the-secrets-of-highly-successful-youtube-shorts-templates/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Decoding the Secrets of Highly Successful YouTube Shorts Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-professional-portals-15-youtube-economic-insights-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Professional Portals 15 YouTube Economic Insights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/comment-choisir-la-meilleure-decoupeuse-pour-fichiers-mkv-pas-de-recoding-necessaire/"><u>Comment Choisir La Meilleure Découpeuse Pour Fichiers MKV - Pas De Recoding Nécessaire!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/deciphering-nyt-influence-dynamics/"><u>Deciphering NYT Influence Dynamics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-of-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Phone Touchscreen Of Samsung Galaxy S23+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-apple-iphone-13-pro-with-forgotten-passcode-different-methods-you-can-try-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro With Forgotten Passcode Different Methods You Can Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/izing-video-game-earnings-for-2024/"><u>Maximizing Video Game Earnings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/speech-to-script-top-apps-for-on-the-go-text-generation/"><u>Speech to Script Top Apps for On-the-Go Text Generation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/top-asmrists-aiding-the-nighttime-ritual/"><u>Top ASMRists Aiding the Nighttime Ritual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/bes-prime-moments-celebrations-beyond-vidcon/"><u>Youtube's Prime Moments Celebrations Beyond VidCon</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Now funny people can reach millions of viewers on YouTube, and all they need are funny video ideas. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html" >Generating great video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> isn’t always easy, but I’m here to help you get over that minor speed bump.</p><p>Let’s dive into the world of YouTube comedy videos and find out which ideas can help you launch your career as a comedian.</p><h2 id="7-Comedy-YouTube-Video-Ideas"><a href="#7-Comedy-YouTube-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="7 Comedy YouTube Video Ideas"></a>7 Comedy YouTube Video Ideas</h2><ol><li><a href="#one">Do a Skit</a></li><li><a href="#two">Start a Funny Series</a></li><li><a href="#three">Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos</a></li><li><a href="#four">Machinima and Gameplay Skits</a></li><li><a href="#five">Parody Videos</a></li><li><a href="#six">Bloopers</a></li><li><a href="#seven">Lip Sync Video</a></li></ol><h4 id="1-Do-a-Skit"><a href="#1-Do-a-Skit" class="headerlink" title="1. Do a Skit"></a>1. Do a Skit</h4><p>YouTube is the perfect medium for short, generally between one and ten minutes long comedy sketches. The majority of the audience on YouTube isn’t patient enough to sit through a half-hour show, no matter how funny it is (at least not until you have a large fan base).</p><p>Your skit can be about literally anything, as long as it’s short and effective. Having your own unique sense of humor is a crucial factor in ensuring the success of the sketches you post online.</p><h4 id="2-Start-a-Funny-Series"><a href="#2-Start-a-Funny-Series" class="headerlink" title="2. Start a Funny Series"></a>2. Start a Funny Series</h4><p>Try producing a pilot episode of a comedy series for your YouTube channel. Don’t worry about the budget too much because if your ideas are good even a DIY approach will be enough.</p><p>Producing a funny series requires dedication and commitment to that goal, so don’t let yourself be discouraged easily.</p><h4 id="3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos"><a href="#3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos"></a>3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos</h4><p>Posting cute videos on your YouTube channel will certainly help you get attention online. The Internet loves videos of adorable babies, cats, dogs and other charming animals. Including these types of videos on your channel can be a good way to boost your subscriber count.</p><p>It is important to note that your content must be unique. Re-posting funny animal videos you find online won’t get you far and will make it impossible to monetize your channel.</p><h4 id="4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits"><a href="#4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits" class="headerlink" title="4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits"></a>4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits</h4><p>The term machinima means creating a cinematic production by re-using material from video games. Gameplay skits and machinima videos are a great way of reaching millions of gaming fans who enjoy good comedy videos.</p><p>The gaming industry is on the rise, and the audience that wants to watch video game-related content is growing every day. However, these types of videos require an in-depth knowledge of the gaming world, and you really have to know the games you draw from in order to make this idea work.</p><h4 id="5-Parody-Video"><a href="#5-Parody-Video" class="headerlink" title="5. Parody Video"></a>5. Parody Video</h4><p>A well done, poignant parody never fails to make people laugh. Pop culture provides an endless source of TV shows, movies, and songs that can be used for your parody videos. When pop stars release big new music videos, they always get parodied by someone on YouTube within the first few days in order to capitalize on the trend while it’s fresh.</p><p>Parody videos will provide you with an opportunity to showcase your skills and enable you to show the world that you are a talented, relevant comedian.</p><h4 id="6-Bloopers"><a href="#6-Bloopers" class="headerlink" title="6. Bloopers"></a>6. Bloopers</h4><p>We all make mistakes. Blooper videos enable us to at least laugh at them. Experienced YouTubers know how easy it is to flub a take, but it takes a brave creator to make an entire video from the shots they messed up.</p><h4 id="7-Lip-Sync-Video"><a href="#7-Lip-Sync-Video" class="headerlink" title="7. Lip-Sync Video"></a>7. Lip-Sync Video</h4><p>Have you ever imagined what it’s like to be a pop star? Lip-sync videos offer the opportunity to step into someone else’s shoes for a moment and have fun with it. Knowing the song you’re lip-syncing and having good timing can help, but you can hardly go wrong producing a video of yourself pouring your soul into a song you’re lip-syncing.</p><p>Lip-syncing to tunes from the most popular stars in the world will enable you to gain traffic from people looking for content related to those songs and artists.</p><p>Need more YouTube video ideas?

Or, do you like to Livestream? These are two perks of having a YouTube account in good standing. You can lose these privileges, have your ability to post videos frozen, and even have your account terminated if you start accumulating strikes.</p><p>If you receive a strike, you will usually be able to get rid of it. This article will show you how.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><p><a href="#strikes">1. Copyright Strikes</a></p><p><a href="#wrong">2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</a></p><p><a href="#community">3. Community Guidelines Strikes</a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-strike.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Strike"                ></p><p> There are two types of strikes: <strong>Community Guideline Strikes</strong> and <strong>Copyright Strikes</strong>. Your account and all your videos will be deleted if you get three of either one of these types of strikes, but YouTube is fair about how these strikes are given out and how you can reverse them.</p><h2 id="1-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#1-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Copyright Strikes"></a>1. Copyright Strikes</h2><p>You get a copyright strike when you use media in your video which someone else owns the copyrights to. Music, clips, photographs, and sound effects are examples of the kinds of media you may use that could be owned by someone else.</p><p>The most obvious way to earn a copyright strike is to repost content which you did not create, i.e. clips from a television show or a popular song. If you know that the content you got a strike for was not yours and did not fall under <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >‘fair use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’, then there are two ways you can resolve it.</p><p>1. You can complete YouTube’s simple course on copyright infringement (<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >Copyright School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and wait three months. Copyright strikes expire in three months so long as you complete the course (they will not expire if you don’t take the course).</p><p>2. you can contact the holder of the copyright and ask them to retract their claim. You will probably have to offer to delete your video. Keep in mind that it is completely up to the rights holder whether you deleting your video is enough for them to retract their claim. They are allowed to say ‘no’.</p><p>Deleting your video, especially if you do so without contacting the rights holder, will not automatically reverse your copyright strike.</p><p>The majority of copyright strikes that you as a YouTube creator receive – if you receive any – will not be as black and white as ‘someone else owns it, you shouldn’t have used it’. If you know that you have a license to use the song or other media you got the strike for, or feel like your use of a clip falls under ‘fair use’, then your path to reversing the strike will be different.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118322/7443" target="_top" id="2118322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118322/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes"></a>2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</h2><p>YouTube’s system for detecting copyright infringement is automated. This means that you can get a copyright strike without actually breaking any rules. These strikes are generally easy to reverse.</p><p>For creators, the most common instance of this is being flagged for using copyrighted music. When you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download royalty-free music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – whether you download it for free or pay for it – you might not realize that that music is still copyrighted to someone else and can still be flagged by YouTube’s system.</p><p>If this has happened to you, reversing it is simple.</p><p>1. Submit a counter-notification through the form provided and include either your licensing information or a link to where it can be found online.</p><p>2. After you submit your counter-notification, the copyright holder will have 10 business days to respond. Since in this scenario the rights holder will know they have allowed their content to be licensed out, there should be no conflict and your video will be reinstated.</p><p>‘Fair use’ is another thing YouTube’s system has no way of detecting. ‘Fair use’ means that you are using content that you do not own, and which you do not have a license to use, but that you are using it in a way that is legally protected. Satire, criticism, education, and news reporting are areas that may be protected by fair use, although every situation is different.</p><p>There is no situation in which crediting a rights holder, adding a disclaimer, or simply not monetizing your video will make it fair use.</p><p>To reverse a copyright strike where you believe your video should be protected as ‘fair use’, submit a counter-notification through the web form YouTube provides. The rights holder will have 10 business days to provide YouTube with evidence that they have initiated a court action against your content. There is a chance that they will not agree with you about the ‘fair use’ status of your video. You could be in for a bit of a fight.</p><p>If your account has been suspended for accumulating multiple strikes, you will no longer be able to access the online counter-notification form and will have to send a free-form counter-notification. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6005919" >Information on that can be found here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134502/19576" target="_top" id="2134502">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134502" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="672" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134502/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes"><a href="#3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="3. Community Guidelines Strikes"></a>3. Community Guidelines Strikes</h2><p>Most video creators – people who post vlogs, travel videos, and various kinds of tutorials – will never receive this type of strike. Sexual content, hateful content, threats, and scams are among the things you could post which would result in a community guidelines strike. Creators, in general, are not interested in posting cruel or graphic content.</p><p>The only thing some video creators might have to be careful of is <strong>misleading metadata</strong>. You can get community guidelines to strike for intentionally using the title, tags, and description of your video to build up an expectation of the content your video does not deliver on. For example, if you post a personal vlog and title it ‘Call of Duty Review’ to try and capitalize on people who might be searching for gaming videos then you might receive a strike.</p><p>Blatantly using keywords that have nothing to do with your content is not something you can do accidentally, but it is possible to be misleading in your metadata without trying to be dishonest. YouTube is a very competitive place, and many creators are turning towards title strategies which could be considered ‘clickbait’. If you say in your title that you had a baby, but reveal in your actual video that ‘had a baby’ meant ‘wrote a new song’, will that get you a community guidelines strike? Probably not, but it can be a thin line.</p><p>In general, just don’t mention anything in your title or tags which you do not talk about in your video.</p><p>Community Guidelines strikes expire after three months. As long as you only have one strike, it will not affect your channel or what you can do on YouTube. If you receive a second strike within the three months of your first strike, you will lose the ability to post videos for two weeks. If you receive a third strike before either of your previous strikes has expired, your account will be terminated.</p><p> Have you experienced a copyright strike against your YouTube channel?

To work on memorable travel videos, I would recommend the following suggestions.</p><h4 id="Record-tons-of-footage"><a href="#Record-tons-of-footage" class="headerlink" title="Record tons of footage"></a>Record tons of footage</h4><p>Most importantly, make sure that you have recorded a lot of content that you can include in your videos. You can later get rid of any content that you don’t like. Though, if you don’t have the right footage, then you won’t be able to create your video in the first place.</p><h4 id="Focus-on-one-thing-at-a-time"><a href="#Focus-on-one-thing-at-a-time" class="headerlink" title="Focus on one thing at a time"></a>Focus on one thing at a time</h4><p>While traveling, you can get overwhelmed and might try to include a lot of things in a single video. Instead, try to focus on one central idea for the video. For instance, you can make a video on your visit to a local market or a historic site. If you want to include more, then make a video collage of the entire trip.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="Add-voiceovers"><a href="#Add-voiceovers" class="headerlink" title="Add voiceovers"></a>Add voiceovers</h4><p>A lot of content creators might not realize this, but voiceovers are extremely important in travel videos. Apart from the visual shots, you should include your experience of what you felt at that time. If you didn’t record your reaction in the original video, then use an editing tool like Filmora to add voiceovers later on.</p><h4 id="Edit-your-videos-with-an-excellent-video-editor"><a href="#Edit-your-videos-with-an-excellent-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="Edit your videos with an excellent video editor"></a>Edit your videos with an excellent video editor</h4><p>If you wish to come up with appealing travel videos, then a video editor would be a must-have tool for you. I would recommend using <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>, which is one of the most extensive and user-friendly video editors out there. You can easily clip the footage of your choice, add voiceovers, and include different transitions. There are tons of presets and media layers that you can include in your videos to make them stand out.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958378/18409" target="_top" id="1958378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1958378/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Be-authentic"><a href="#Be-authentic" class="headerlink" title="Be authentic"></a>Be authentic</h4><p>In the end, make sure that you share a genuine experience with others.

People will subscribe when they feel invested in you as a person, and that happens when they feel like you are being sincere. You do not need to share all of your innermost secrets on your vlog, but you should let your viewers feel like they know you.</p><h3 id="2-Don’t-forget-to-add-a-call-to-action"><a href="#2-Don’t-forget-to-add-a-call-to-action" class="headerlink" title="2.

At the end of all your videos, ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel and like your social media page.</p><p>Don’t forget to explain the benefits of subscribing to them, such as to benefit from your informative tips and gain a deeper insight into your projects.

If people feel comfortable enough to leave you suggestions and requests then that is even better. It means that you have succeeded in making them feel like they are part of your community.</p><p>If you get a video request, try to do it. People like to feel that you are open to trying the things they want to see. However, there are also times when you should just ignore requests and suggestions. If the majority of your subscribers enjoy your jokes and you get one comment telling you to stop trying to be funny then it is fairly obvious that that ‘suggestion’ does not really reflect the wishes of your community.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subscriber02.JPG"                      alt="get subscriber"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-your-title"><a href="#4-Optimize-your-title" class="headerlink" title="4.

These goals can include milestones such as reaching 500 followers, 1,000 followers and so on. Don’t hesitate to tell your viewers about these goals – if they think your content is of real value, chances are they will be only too happy to assist you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-goals.JPG"                      alt="goals"                ></p><h3 id="2-Contests-can-be-funny-–-why-not-enter-one"><a href="#2-Contests-can-be-funny-–-why-not-enter-one" class="headerlink" title="2.

A site called Gleam can oversee a contest for you. It’s up to you to choose how you want the contest to work, and you can gain an edge over your competitors by getting people to leave comments, follow you on Instagram, subscribe to your channel and more.</p><p>You will be provided with a landing page for promoting your channel, and you can share this in a variety of places, including on your Facebook, Twitter and blog. The best way to heighten your chances of success is to have a clear goal in mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-contest.JPG"                      alt="video0 contest"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657386/16446" target="_top" id="1657386">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657386" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657386/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Make-a-trailer"><a href="#3-Make-a-trailer" class="headerlink" title="3.

Make a trailer</h3><p>YouTube’s channel interface allows you to add a <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3031012/9-short-storytelling-tips-from-a-master-of-movie-trailers" >trailer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to entice viewers into watching your videos and following you on the platform. Your trailer gives you a valuable opportunity to quickly explain what your channel is all about and what the benefits of following you are.</p><p>Don’t waffle on – try to get your clip down to 90 seconds maximum. Include clips from your videos and don’t forget to add a strong call to action at the end. The more effort you put into your videos, the bigger the rewards are likely to become. And here are some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best trailer makers that you can use on both Windows and Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-killer-youtube-channel-trailer.jpg"                      alt="trailer"                ></p><h3 id="4-Make-a-Schedule-and-Stick-To-It"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule-and-Stick-To-It" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It"></a>4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It</h3><p>You want to vlog at least once a week, and making a schedule will help you keep on top of that. It will also give your subscribers a chance to anticipate your videos and get excited. They are more likely to watch an update they have been expecting than one that was not already on their minds.</p><p>Sticking to your schedule is a good wait to build up credibility with your audience, but late or skipped updates will cause you to lose that credibility. If you do not post for a month then people who already subscribed to you might still ignore your update because it has been too long and they forgot about you.</p><h3 id="5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers"><a href="#5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers"></a>5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers</h3><p>Collaboration videos are always big hits. When you collaborate with another vlogger you are essentially introducing each other to your subscribers. This is a great way to grow your community quickly: by connecting it to another community.</p><p>Collaborations work best when the other vlogger is located close enough to you that you can actually meet up, but you can do distance collaborations too. When you collaborate you and the other vlogger should have close to the same number of subscribers, so the video will benefit you both equally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cooperation.JPG"                      alt="cooperation"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]"></a>Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]</h2><p>There are lots of ways to get free YouTube subscribers. This proven method involves networking with other creators! Making your presence felt on YouTube is an important part of creating your network of subscribers that watch, share and talk about your videos. Interaction with your subscribers, reaching new audiences every day, and a plethora of other factors influence how well your YouTube channel is doing.</p><p>In this part, we will show you how you can build your own network of loyal YouTube supporters and prove that you don’t need the services of paid providers who promise better reach for your channel.</p><h3 id="1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche"><a href="#1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche" class="headerlink" title="1. Find YouTubers in your niche"></a>1. Find YouTubers in your niche</h3><p>The first step to building an enviable army of YouTube subscribers starts with the realization that you are not alone. Regardless of the niche, your videos are covering, there are probably thousands of people who are just starting out or that have as many subscribers as your YouTube channel. Focus on finding them. You may even want to make a list.</p><h3 id="2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like"><a href="#2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like" class="headerlink" title="2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like"></a>2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like</h3><p>Of the channels you found in Step 1, choose the ones you genuinely like and subscribe to them.</p><p>It goes without saying that everyone enjoys support, especially if you are not asking for anything in return. By subscribing to YouTube channels in your genre you appreciate, you will make yourself known to the channel’s owner, and there is a chance they will check out and subscribe to your channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139118/17108" target="_top" id="2139118">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139118" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139118/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day"><a href="#3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day" class="headerlink" title="3.

Spend time watching videos each day</h3><p>Knowledge is power and, if you want to attract real people to your channel, you should learn how to use your knowledge to your advantage. By paying attention to other new videos in your genre you’ll gain insight into what is going over well with audiences like yours, and what isn’t.</p><p>Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1498635">                    <video width="320" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1498635">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:200px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fancheer.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1498635%2F17326'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1498635/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return"><a href="#4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return" class="headerlink" title="4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return"></a>4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return</h3><p>Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else’s positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.</p><p>If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don’t be the person who’s always saying ‘Subscribe to my channel’. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.</p><h3 id="5-Reach-out-on-social-media"><a href="#5-Reach-out-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="5. Reach out on social media"></a>5. Reach out on social media</h3><p>YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.</p><p>Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.</p><h3 id="6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again"><a href="#6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again" class="headerlink" title="6. Do it all again. And again. And again"></a>6. Do it all again. And again. And again</h3><p>You aren’t going to see great results overnight. You have to spend time almost every day repeating the steps we just described. This might seem intimidating, but as time passes it will become routine.</p><p>When you build your presence on YouTube in this way, other creators and their subscribers will naturally start becoming your subscribers. What’s your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe. If you stop making videos because you did not get any subscribers or comments on your first few then chances are there were people who were paying attention who may have subscribed if you had kept at it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

You get entertained and also have a chance to share your videos with the world. Among the popular apps are TikTok and Shorts. TikTok got to the market earlier but has so far found a new competitor in the field. Shorts video has now fully emerged from YouTube and has almost the same playing ground. But it is still unclear whether <strong>YouTube Shorts and TikTok</strong> are comparable. While TikTok has over 2 billion downloads, YouTube, on the other hand, already has a massive audience for the tough tussle.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts give both creators and viewers the chance to share short videos for entertainment and promotional purposes. However, they are different in various aspects. Both the apps have their disadvantages and advantages, depending on a user’s preference. Dive into the next section to discover whether TikTok’s impact is about to be threatened by YouTube Shorts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shorts-tiktok-compare.png"                      alt="compare youtube shorts with tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing"><a href="#Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing" class="headerlink" title="Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?"></a>Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</h2><p>Shorts and TikTok are not the same in various ways. TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version. These two apps have adequate similarities and differences.</p><p>They are both for short-form videos and allow creators to add music from audio libraries. You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes. You can also view TikTok directly from its app while for Shorts, you need a separate app, YouTube.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage"><a href="#YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?"></a>YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</h2><p>Let’s focus on the TikTok and Shorts video by perusing the similarities and differences deeply.</p><h3 id="Similiarity"><a href="#Similiarity" class="headerlink" title="- Similiarity"></a>- Similiarity</h3><p>Check out in which aspects TikTok and Shorts are similar to each other.</p><h5 id="1-Monetization"><a href="#1-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="1) Monetization"></a>1) Monetization</h5><p>Both platforms provide creators with tools to earn money from their content. TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.</p><p>You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.</p><h5 id="2-Analytics"><a href="#2-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="2) Analytics"></a>2) Analytics</h5><p>Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling.

You get entertained and also have a chance to share your videos with the world. Among the popular apps are TikTok and Shorts. TikTok got to the market earlier but has so far found a new competitor in the field. Shorts video has now fully emerged from YouTube and has almost the same playing ground. But it is still unclear whether <strong>YouTube Shorts and TikTok</strong> are comparable. While TikTok has over 2 billion downloads, YouTube, on the other hand, already has a massive audience for the tough tussle.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts give both creators and viewers the chance to share short videos for entertainment and promotional purposes. However, they are different in various aspects. Both the apps have their disadvantages and advantages, depending on a user’s preference. Dive into the next section to discover whether TikTok’s impact is about to be threatened by YouTube Shorts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shorts-tiktok-compare.png"                      alt="compare youtube shorts with tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?</a></p><h2 id="Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing-3"><a href="#Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing-3" class="headerlink" title="Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?"></a>Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</h2><p>Shorts and TikTok are not the same in various ways. TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version. These two apps have adequate similarities and differences.</p><p>They are both for short-form videos and allow creators to add music from audio libraries. You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes. You can also view TikTok directly from its app while for Shorts, you need a separate app, YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage-3"><a href="#YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage-3" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?"></a>YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</h2><p>Let’s focus on the TikTok and Shorts video by perusing the similarities and differences deeply.</p><h3 id="Similiarity-3"><a href="#Similiarity-3" class="headerlink" title="- Similiarity"></a>- Similiarity</h3><p>Check out in which aspects TikTok and Shorts are similar to each other.</p><h5 id="1-Monetization-3"><a href="#1-Monetization-3" class="headerlink" title="1) Monetization"></a>1) Monetization</h5><p>Both platforms provide creators with tools to earn money from their content.

Above all, it works independently, a feature that most users adore as compared to the encasing of Shorts within YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-beyond-blockbuster-horizons-favorite-films/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Beyond Blockbuster Horizons Favorite Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-channel-transformation-through-strategic-use-of-youtube-outros/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Channel Transformation Through Strategic Use of YouTube Outros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-direct-the-degrees-cutting-edge-youtube-video-manipulation/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Direct the Degrees Cutting-Edge YouTube Video Manipulation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-simplified-playlist-crafting-for-youtube-fans-on-desktop-and-mobile-devices/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Simplified Playlist Crafting for YouTube Fans on Desktop & Mobile Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-risk-and-revelation-10-roguelike-game-selection/"><u>2024 Approved Risk and Revelation #10 Roguelike Game Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tinyshot-critique-of-small-scale-recording-app/"><u>2024 Approved TinyShot Critique of Small-Scale Recording App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/best-realme-c67-4g-pattern-lock-removal-tools-remove-android-pattern-lock-without-losing-data-by-drfone-android/"><u>Best Realme C67 4G Pattern Lock Removal Tools Remove Android Pattern Lock Without Losing Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-on-a-locked-poco-x5-pro-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Enable USB Debugging on a Locked Poco X5 Pro Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-ideal-history-streams-the-10-premier-channels-for-students-study/"><u>In 2024, Ideal History Streams The 10 Premier Channels for Students' Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/peering-into-pitfalls-a-deep-dive-into-vr-shortcomings/"><u>Peering Into Pitfalls A Deep Dive Into VR Shortcomings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/trust-in-ai-communication-uncovering-whether-chatgpt-tells-lies/"><u>Trust in AI Communication: Uncovering Whether ChatGPT Tells Lies</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags"></a>1. Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags</h3><p>YouTube’s search engine can be your best ally on the quest for great tags. This tool was created to aid users who are looking for content on the platform, and content creators can benefit from it as well. By typing the general topic of your video, or a few words vaguely related to your video, into the search bar on YouTube you can see suggestions that reflect what viewers are searching for and take some of those suggestions into consideration for your tags. With every new phrase (and even every additional character you type), new options will appear. By playing around with this tool you will gain valuable insight into the searching habits of YouTube viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-tag-by-searching.jpg"                      alt=" Find YouTube Video Tag"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135372/19272" target="_top" id="2135372">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135372" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135372/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This method may not be too precise, but the idea is to quickly gather information and perhaps get some inspiration for more creative or complex tags. Most of the suggestions will be logical, but there can be a few unexpected combinations you’d never think of. Be very careful when translating the findings to your own situation, since the fact that some terms are popular doesn’t mean they are relevant for your video. Another problem is that slightly altered terminology can significantly change the effectiveness of the tag, so you should ideally use the suggested phrases in the exact form as you found them or not at all. If you do make adjustments, you should test the new tag through the same auto-complete tool and see how it fares.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997675/19272" target="_top" id="1997675">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997675" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997675/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Try-YouTube-Tag-Generators"><a href="#2-Try-YouTube-Tag-Generators" class="headerlink" title="2.  Try YouTube Tag Generators"></a>2.  Try YouTube Tag Generators</h3><p>If you’d like to dig a little deeper, there are multiple dedicated tools that can assist you in picking the most suitable YouTube tags for every video you upload. Let’s examine a few of them in greater detail:</p><h4 id="1-Keyword-Tool"><a href="#1-Keyword-Tool" class="headerlink" title="#1. Keyword Tool"></a>#1. <a class="link"   href="https://keywordtool.io/youtube" >Keyword Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>A very simple and reliable web-based tag generator that provides you with 750 frequently searched keywords that would be suitable for your video. The keyword list is based on YouTube’s search tool in a way similar to what we described in the previous chapter. However, since the analysis is automated with the Keyword Tool, you can get a huge list in just a few seconds. This generator is especially useful when you are looking for long-tail keywords that attract niche audiences.</p><h4 id="2-Rapid-Tags"><a href="#2-Rapid-Tags" class="headerlink" title="#2. Rapid Tags"></a>#2. <a class="link"   href="https://rapidtags.io/" >Rapid Tags <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This tool is a bit more sophisticated and includes some analytic features on top of tag generating capacities, allowing you to manage your channel more effectively. It’s completely automated, so you won’t have to do any heavy lifting on your own. Just type the URL of your video into the appropriate field and let Rapid Tags do the rest. You can easily switch between the Generator, Analyzer, Ranker, and Tracker tools, so you can acquire a complete picture of the suitability of each tag and a better understanding of the projected performance of your video.</p><p>Want more tools to generate YouTube tags? Check our picks of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best YouTube video tag generators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-BetterWaytoWeb"><a href="#3-BetterWaytoWeb" class="headerlink" title="#3.

It can suggest suitable tags for your new video based on the main keyword you provide, speeding up your research considerably. It can also analyze the tags placed on an existing YouTube video, which is important for deducing how other authors working in the same category are optimizing their content.</p><h3 id="3-Study-Your-YouTube-Rivals’-Tags"><a href="#3-Study-Your-YouTube-Rivals’-Tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Study Your YouTube Rivals’ Tags"></a>3. Study Your YouTube Rivals’ Tags</h3><p>YouTube content authors can learn a lot by analyzing their top competitors. No matter what your videos are about, there are probably countless other creators that want to attract the same audiences as you. Only a tiny percentage of them will manage to gain significant viewership, and those are the ones you should be researching in detail.</p><p>If you are able to locate the most successful videos with content similar to yours you are already halfway to your goal, but one obstacle still remains. You can’t even see your competitor’s tags them when you click on their videos on YouTube. This type of information is not displayed, but some specialized solutions are able to reveal it upon request. Here is one YouTube certified analytic tool capable of doing that:</p><h4 id="1-VidIQ"><a href="#1-VidIQ" class="headerlink" title="1. VidIQ"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Currently used to manage more than 30,000 YouTube channels, this powerful video marketing suite can also help with tag selection. It can enlarge your tag library by a factor of 10, and provide you with a direct comparison with your chief competitors. In addition to increasing your views, this app can help you monitor your visibility on social networks, and track detailed statistics that describe the performance of your video. In other words, this is a comprehensive package that will help you manage your channel in a professional way.</p><p>What’s your YouTube tag strategy?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043855/7443" target="_top" id="2043855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Tag-FAQs"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Tag-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: YouTube Tag FAQs"></a>Part 2: YouTube Tag FAQs</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-YouTube-Tag"><a href="#1-What-is-YouTube-Tag" class="headerlink" title="1. What is YouTube Tag?"></a>1. What is YouTube Tag?</h4><p>YouTube tag is a keyword that you added to help Google and YouTube understand your video context, which is an important ranking factor in YouTube searching. Basically, the better you tag your video, the more views you can get. But you should keep in mind that adding excessive tags to your video description is against YouTube policy.</p><h4 id="2-How-Many-Tags-Should-You-Use-on-YouTube"><a href="#2-How-Many-Tags-Should-You-Use-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="2.

In most cases, 5-8 tags are appreciated for a YouTube video. It is recommended to add as many relevant tags as you can, such as brand-specific tags, YouTube auto-suggest tags, or tags created with some tag generator.</p><h4 id="3-Do-Tags-on-YouTube-Get-More-Views"><a href="#3-Do-Tags-on-YouTube-Get-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Tags on YouTube Get More Views?"></a>3. Do Tags on YouTube Get More Views?</h4><p>The short answer is Yes. Since Google is encouraging people to use tags to help them understand your video content, then it can recommend the videos to relevant users accordingly.

For example, when you search tag #FilmoraSchoolStory in YouTube, you can see all the videos with the tag in the search result. allowing viewers to find your content more easily.</p><h4

To access this feature using a mobile device, go to the <strong>Account</strong> tab and tap <strong>History</strong>.</p><p>You will be able to completely clear your watch history, remove specific videos from it, or pause your history while you look at videos you don’t want a record of you visiting. By taking control of your history, you can make sure nothing you looked up on a random whim is reflected in your recommendations.</p><p>If you are being recommended more things you aren’t interested in than things you are, you might want to clear your history completely and start fresh.

Nobody outside of Google knows exactly how the algorithm works, but we do know one of the major factors influencing it is to watch <strong>time</strong>.</p><p>Watch time refers to how a video effects the session time of a viewer. If a video has proven it can keep viewers on YouTube for longer it is more likely to get recommended, even if it isn’t closely related to the interests of individual viewers. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to keep you on the site longer. Part of that is recommending things, surely, you’ll be interested in, and part of that is trying to get you interested in things that’ll keep you around.</p><p>  A video that is simply watched for longer, because it is engaging and can hold viewers’ attention for a long time, will have a high watch time. So will a video that is short, but which leads into a playlist which holds peoples’ attention. If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.</p><p>The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.</p><p> Are you usually happy with YouTube’s recommended videos?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100529/7443" target="_top" id="2100529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used"><a href="#What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used" class="headerlink" title="What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?"></a>What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-earn-on-youtube-decoding-recent-policy-changes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Earn on YouTube Decoding Recent Policy Changes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-cutting-edge-visual-techniques-selecting-premium-camera-lenses/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Cutting-Edge Visual Techniques Selecting Premium Camera Lenses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-youtubing-green-magic-ideas-that-come-to-life/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Youtubing Green Magic – Ideas That Come to Life</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-radiance-reimagined-top-video-tools-list/"><u>[Updated] Radiance Reimagined Top Video Tools List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-secret-behind-the-blue-status-update-sticker/"><u>[Updated] The Secret Behind the Blue Status Update Sticker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-this-years-offbeat-movie-masterpieces/"><u>2024 Approved This Year’s Offbeat Movie Masterpieces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/cheap-and-quick-camera-picks-your-2024-photography-buddy/"><u>Cheap & Quick Camera Picks -

Almost 91% of the music fans would listen to the samples before they purchase a song on iTunes. “Watching” music is getting more and more popular with Youtube’s arising popularity among music fans.</p><p> However, here comes the dilemma if you are trying to share your favorite music list with your friends on Youtube since Youtube is not designed to host files that are purely audio. Only video files are allowed to be uploaded to its server. Despite all this, is there a safe and easy solution to this issue? The answer if absolutely Yes! <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare audio converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let you upload an MP3 to Youtube by converting them to videos files first without losing any of its quality, helping you remove the barrier of uploading audio files to Youtube.</p><p> With it, you can not only add pictures to your MP3 files but also retouch them with various fantastic effects.

Since YouTube is a visual media platform, viewers set their eyes on the thumbnails first before they read the title of the video. If you’ve made a collage of YouTube thumbnails or designed YouTube channel art containing various freeze-frame images from different YouTube videos, you are no stranger to needing a fast way to collect YouTube thumbnail images. Online, there are several tools dedicated to solving this exact problem. These are the top five YouTube Thumbnail grabbers:</p><p>These thumbnails can be then be used in videos, blogs, articles, web pages, etc. Let’s have a look at 8 best thumbnail grabbers in the market:</p><ol><li><a href="#youtubegrabber1">YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber2">BoingBoing</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber3">Thumbnailsave.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber4">Get YouTube Thumbnail</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber5">Fbutube.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber6">YT Thumbnail Downloader</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber7">Youtubethumbnailimage.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber8">Youthumbnail.com</a></li></ol><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-YouTube-Thumbnail-Grabber"><a href="#1-YouTube-Thumbnail-Grabber" class="headerlink" title="#1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber"></a>#1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-grabber.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail Grabber"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com/" >https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>YouTube Thumbnail Grabber is at the top of our list. The website is very simple and clean with no ads. All you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click on the “Download Images” button. The site will then present you with your downloadable images in different sizes. It’s free and fast!</p><h2 id="2-BoingBoing"><a href="#2-BoingBoing" class="headerlink" title="#2: BoingBoing"></a>#2: BoingBoing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boing-boing.jpg"                      alt="Boing Boing"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html" >https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>BoingBoing is faster than YouTube Thumbnail grabber because it skips the “Download Images” step. As soon as you enter in your YouTube video URL, BoingBoing will automatically present you with your downloadable images. Although it is one step faster than YouTube Thumbnail Grabber, you will have to deal with having to view one small ad at the bottom of the page. In case you also want to download freeze frames that occur midway through the video, BoingBoing also gives you the option to download those images as well.</p><h2 id="3-Thumbnailsave-com"><a href="#3-Thumbnailsave-com" class="headerlink" title="#3: Thumbnailsave.com"></a>#3: Thumbnailsave.com</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thumbnail-save.jpg"                      alt="Thumbnail Save"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1936838">                    <video width="374" height="48" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1936838.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1936838">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1936838.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:234px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fcoinrule.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1936838%2F18409'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1936838/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="http://thumbnailsave.com/" >http://thumbnailsave.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Another free, straightforward website for grabbing your YouTube thumbnails is Thumbnailsave.com. Again, all you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click the “Submit” button. Unlike our first two options, this site has a lot more ads. You’ll see a banner ad at the top as well as an ad to the side of the page. One interesting thing about this website is that it displays a column of thumbnails recently grabbed by users all over the world (displayed on the right side of the page). You might find this entertaining. If you are captivated by one of the thumbnail images, you can download it onto your computer and then do a reverse image search on Google to find the video.</p><h2 id="4-Get-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#4-Get-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="#4: Get YouTube Thumbnail"></a>#4: Get YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-youtube-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Get YouTube Thumbnail"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com/" >http://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Get YouTube Thumbnail is another free, straightforward tool for grabbing YouTube thumbnail images. All you need to do is paste the URL of the YouTube video and click on the “Get YouTube Thumbnail” button to retrieve your thumbnail. Yes, that’s right. One thumbnail image. What’s different about this website is that it provides you with a unique image URL. This might be useful for anyone not wanting to deal with files. While this website is free to use, it does have ads.</p><h2 id="5-Fbutube-com"><a href="#5-Fbutube-com" class="headerlink" title="#5: Fbutube.com"></a>#5: Fbutube.com</h2><p>Fbtube.com is a tool that is used to download YouTube thumbnails by bloggers, YouTubers, graphic designers, etc. This tool helps to grab all the thumbnails available for a YouTube video.
