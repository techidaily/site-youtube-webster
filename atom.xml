Since it’s a free and simple way to make extra bucks, showing ads with the content you produce for online platforms, it’s essential to know how much it pays for views.</p><h3 id="Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense"><a href="#Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense"></a>Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense</h3><p>For 1,000 views, expect AdSense to pay around $8-$20. However, your total earnings will depend on factors such as your content type, users’ location, and setting of ads in Google AdSense, so it can pay on thousand views.</p><p>More so, AdSense opts for Revenue Per 1,000 impressions or (RPM) to showcase the amount you would get for 1,000 impressions. Remember, this RPM doesn’t include the actual amount you’ve earned. But it focuses on dividing your earnings by page views and impressions, then multiplying those by 1,000.</p><p>You can also refer to the formula for better understanding.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/190515" >RPM &#x3D; (Estimated earnings &#x2F; Number of page views) * 1000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>From this formula provided by Google official, we can easily know that</p><p>Estimated earnings &#x3D; (RPM * Number of page views) &#x2F; 1000</p><p>To understand it further, see the example below.</p><p>Suppose you’ve earned around $0.10 from 20 page views; your page RPM would be $6.00 in simpler terms.</p><p>($0.10 &#x2F; 25) * 1000 &#x3D; $6.00</p><p>Also, if RPM is $4.00 from 45,000 ad impressions, your estimated earnings would be equal $180.00</p><p>($4.00 * 45,000) &#x2F; 1000 &#x3D; $180.00</p><h3 id="AdSense-Pay-Per-View"><a href="#AdSense-Pay-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="AdSense Pay Per View"></a>AdSense Pay Per View</h3><p>Lastly, if you’re looking for an exact answer regarding how much it pays per view, know that it varies and is based on different factors, such as niche or audience demographic.</p><p>But you can expect something between $8 to $12 on 1,000 views after monetizing your YouTube channel with your Google AdSense account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?"></a>Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-2.jpg"                      alt="pay per click"                ></p><p>After understanding AdSense’s way to pay for 1,000 views, formula, or pay per view, here’s what you need to know about AdSense’s payment on per click policy.</p><p>On Average, you can expect AdSense to pay something around $0.20 to $15 on a click.

Now funny people can reach millions of viewers on YouTube, and all they need are funny video ideas. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html" >Generating great video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> isn’t always easy, but I’m here to help you get over that minor speed bump.</p><p>Let’s dive into the world of YouTube comedy videos and find out which ideas can help you launch your career as a comedian.</p><h2 id="7-Comedy-YouTube-Video-Ideas"><a href="#7-Comedy-YouTube-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="7 Comedy YouTube Video Ideas"></a>7 Comedy YouTube Video Ideas</h2><ol><li><a href="#one">Do a Skit</a></li><li><a href="#two">Start a Funny Series</a></li><li><a href="#three">Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos</a></li><li><a href="#four">Machinima and Gameplay Skits</a></li><li><a href="#five">Parody Videos</a></li><li><a href="#six">Bloopers</a></li><li><a href="#seven">Lip Sync Video</a></li></ol><h4 id="1-Do-a-Skit"><a href="#1-Do-a-Skit" class="headerlink" title="1. Do a Skit"></a>1. Do a Skit</h4><p>YouTube is the perfect medium for short, generally between one and ten minutes long comedy sketches. The majority of the audience on YouTube isn’t patient enough to sit through a half-hour show, no matter how funny it is (at least not until you have a large fan base).</p><p>Your skit can be about literally anything, as long as it’s short and effective. Having your own unique sense of humor is a crucial factor in ensuring the success of the sketches you post online.</p><h4 id="2-Start-a-Funny-Series"><a href="#2-Start-a-Funny-Series" class="headerlink" title="2. Start a Funny Series"></a>2. Start a Funny Series</h4><p>Try producing a pilot episode of a comedy series for your YouTube channel. Don’t worry about the budget too much because if your ideas are good even a DIY approach will be enough.</p><p>Producing a funny series requires dedication and commitment to that goal, so don’t let yourself be discouraged easily.</p><h4 id="3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos"><a href="#3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos"></a>3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos</h4><p>Posting cute videos on your YouTube channel will certainly help you get attention online. The Internet loves videos of adorable babies, cats, dogs and other charming animals. Including these types of videos on your channel can be a good way to boost your subscriber count.</p><p>It is important to note that your content must be unique. Re-posting funny animal videos you find online won’t get you far and will make it impossible to monetize your channel.</p><h4 id="4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits"><a href="#4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits" class="headerlink" title="4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits"></a>4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits</h4><p>The term machinima means creating a cinematic production by re-using material from video games. Gameplay skits and machinima videos are a great way of reaching millions of gaming fans who enjoy good comedy videos.</p><p>The gaming industry is on the rise, and the audience that wants to watch video game-related content is growing every day. However, these types of videos require an in-depth knowledge of the gaming world, and you really have to know the games you draw from in order to make this idea work.</p><h4 id="5-Parody-Video"><a href="#5-Parody-Video" class="headerlink" title="5. Parody Video"></a>5. Parody Video</h4><p>A well done, poignant parody never fails to make people laugh. Pop culture provides an endless source of TV shows, movies, and songs that can be used for your parody videos. When pop stars release big new music videos, they always get parodied by someone on YouTube within the first few days in order to capitalize on the trend while it’s fresh.</p><p>Parody videos will provide you with an opportunity to showcase your skills and enable you to show the world that you are a talented, relevant comedian.</p><h4 id="6-Bloopers"><a href="#6-Bloopers" class="headerlink" title="6. Bloopers"></a>6. Bloopers</h4><p>We all make mistakes. Blooper videos enable us to at least laugh at them. Experienced YouTubers know how easy it is to flub a take, but it takes a brave creator to make an entire video from the shots they messed up.</p><h4 id="7-Lip-Sync-Video"><a href="#7-Lip-Sync-Video" class="headerlink" title="7. Lip-Sync Video"></a>7. Lip-Sync Video</h4><p>Have you ever imagined what it’s like to be a pop star? Lip-sync videos offer the opportunity to step into someone else’s shoes for a moment and have fun with it. Knowing the song you’re lip-syncing and having good timing can help, but you can hardly go wrong producing a video of yourself pouring your soul into a song you’re lip-syncing.</p><p>Lip-syncing to tunes from the most popular stars in the world will enable you to gain traffic from people looking for content related to those songs and artists.</p><p>Need more YouTube video ideas?

If you do comedy, fashion, gaming, vlogging, or any other major genre then you are competing with thousands of other channels. In order to grow you need to stand out, and that’s why it’s important to build a strong, clear, brand.</p><ol><li><a href="#unique">Your Brand is Your Unique Message</a></li><li><a href="#Elevator">The Elevator Pitch</a></li><li><a href="#building">How to Start Building Your Brand</a></li><li><a href="#consistent">Being Consistent</a></li></ol><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Make-A-Creative-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Make-A-Creative-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip-Make A Creative YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip-Make A Creative YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>No Doubt, Filmora is the one of the best tools for newbie editors, vloggers and vine artists as it has all the features and tools they might be looking for. Some features make it the most reliable tool of all times. The split screen presets, royalty-free music, video transitions, filters, text templates, and advanced color tuning, etc are the first and foremost requirement of an editor who is looking ahead to build a personal brand on YouTube channel and earn some money from it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Your-Brand-is-Your-Unique-Message"><a href="#Your-Brand-is-Your-Unique-Message" class="headerlink" title="Your Brand is Your Unique Message"></a>Your Brand is Your Unique Message</h2><p>Competing on YouTube is all about offering value. Viewers should be able to find something on your channel that they can’t find anywhere else. This doesn’t mean you need to bend over backwards trying to<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-be-original-on-youtube-289.html" >invent brand new video ideas that nobody has ever tried before <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – it just means you need to focus on building your unique brand. That is what will make viewers subscribe to you instead of just watching one of your videos and then clicking away.</p><h2 id="The-Elevator-Pitch"><a href="#The-Elevator-Pitch" class="headerlink" title="The Elevator Pitch"></a>The Elevator Pitch</h2><p>If you had 20 seconds – a short elevator ride – to describe your channel in a way that would make someone want to subscribe, what would you say?</p><p>Think about if you were trying to describe your new favorite show to a friend. You wouldn’t stop at saying ‘it’s a comedy’ or ‘it’s about lawyers’ – that doesn’t really tell them anything. You would describe the style of comedy, the personalities of characters you love, and the kinds of plots the show offers.</p><p>You need to be able to do that when you talk about your channel.</p><blockquote><p>What is your style of comedy?</p><p>What is your attitude towards fashion?</p><p>What will a viewer get out of watching you make pasta that they won’t get from watching someone else make pasta?</p></blockquote><p>Work on developing an elevator pitch for your channel. It will help you define your brand for yourself, and it’ll be useful if you make a channel trailer.</p><h2 id="How-to-Start-Building-Your-Brand"><a href="#How-to-Start-Building-Your-Brand" class="headerlink" title="How to Start Building Your Brand"></a>How to Start Building Your Brand</h2><p>Building a brand should be intentional. You need to be yourself, but it’s not enough to just ‘be’. You need to create yourself.</p><p>  In order to figure out what unique value you’re bringing to YouTube you’ll need to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/understanding-youtube-analytics-%E2%80%93-take-charge-of-your-channel%21-286.html" >pay attention to your channel stats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and comments your viewers make. It can also be a good idea to ask for feedback from friends who you know will be honest with you.</p><p>You will notice patterns. There will be things you do in your video that people consistently like more and less. The way you build your brand is by cutting out the stuff that isn’t working and focusing more intentionally on the stuff that is. If people like it when you do meme humor, for example, do more meme humor and make incorporating that in your videos part of your brand.</p><p>Banners and thumbnails are also a part of your brand. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-youtube-banners-and-thumbnails-316.html" >More on that here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Being-Consistent"><a href="#Being-Consistent" class="headerlink" title="Being Consistent"></a>Being Consistent</h2><p>The key to branding is consistency. People need to be able to set expectations.</p><p>For every video you do, ask yourself these questions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Who are you?</em></p><p><em>What is your message?</em></p><p><em>What value are you providing?</em></p><p><em>Who is it for?</em></p></blockquote><p>The answers to these questions make up your brand. They may change gradually over time – i.e. if you start making videos as a 16 year old, for other 16 year olds, then the ‘Who is it for?’ will change as you and your subscriber base get older – but in general the answers should always be the same. If your ‘message’ is positive and empowering, then it should always be positive and empowering.</p><p>When you intentionally create your personal brand on YouTube, you take charge of the message you’re sending.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-guiding-imovie-content-from-home-studio-to-youtube-hub/"><u>In 2024, Guiding iMovie Content From Home Studio to YouTube Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-building-audience-connection-with-empowerment-vlogs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Building Audience Connection with Empowerment Vlogs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-game-masters-top-ten-female-gaming-influencers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Game Masters  Top Ten Female Gaming Influencers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/esigning-short-trailers-that-tell-a-story/"><u>[New] Designing Short Trailers That Tell a Story</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ing-authenticity-of-your-youtube-account/"><u>Ensuring Authenticity of Your YouTube Account</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-learn-the-process-of-capturing-your-watched-youtube-content-without-spending/"><u>In 2024, Learn the Process of Capturing Your Watched YouTube Content Without Spending</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-youtubers-spotlighting-niche-gaming-subcultures/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Youtubers Spotlighting Niche Gaming Subcultures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/mline-free-webinar-organizing-with-youtube-help/"><u>Streamline Free Webinar Organizing with YouTube Help</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-realme-v30-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Realme V30? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-poco-m6-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Can I use iTools gpx file to catch the rare Pokemon On Poco M6 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/invisible-impact-the-underestimated-toll-of-trick-likes-for-2024/"><u>Invisible Impact  The Underestimated Toll of Trick Likes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-background-music-remover-app-for-android-and-iphone/"><u>New 2024 Approved Top Background Music Remover App For Android And iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enlightenment-echoes-best-ed-tutorials-yt/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Enlightenment Echoes  Best Ed Tutorials YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-from-oppo-a1x-5g-to-samsung-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Data from Oppo A1x 5G to Samsung Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-your-brand-the-ultimate-guide-to-linkedin-video-dimensions/"><u>2024 Approved Elevate Your Brand The Ultimate Guide to LinkedIn Video Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-elevate-your-films-soundtrack-top-imovie-audio-editing-secrets-revealed/"><u>New Elevate Your Films Soundtrack Top iMovie Audio Editing Secrets Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-definitive-guide-to-adding-texts-and-boosting-engagement-on-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Definitive Guide to Adding Texts and Boosting Engagement on TikTok</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Some YouTubers just love making videos and created their channels so they would have somewhere to post their work. Others have strong opinions they need a platform to share. There are a lot of people on YouTube whose main interest is in a separate website or other social media page, but they use their YouTube channels to help generate traffic. If you are considering starting your own YouTube channel then you should take a second to consider why you want to, since this will have an impact on what kind of videos you make. Your reasons for wanting to make a YouTube account do not have to be very elaborate. Maybe you just think it will be fun. Good news; it will be!</p><p>Once you know for sure that you want to create a YouTube account, and also know why you want to do it, you have already started building your channel. There are still a few important things to consider, though. This article will walk you through signing up for a YouTube account, and give you some tips about starting your channel.</p><h2 id="Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps"><a href="#Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps"></a>Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p><p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"                      alt="account sign in screen"                ></p><p>3. In the sign up page you will need to put in your name, email address, and mobile phone number as well as some other personal information. Do not enter your current Gmail address. Enter an alternate email you have created for your vlog, or click on I would like a new Gmail address. This will change your page slightly so that the email field becomes Choose a Username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account new gmail"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-after-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account after new gmail"                ></p><p>You will probably need to try a few different usernames before you find one that is not taken.</p><p>4. You will have to put in both a first and last name when you create your account, but you can change it to one name later.</p><p>5. Your password will need to be at least 8 characters long. Try to use a combination of letters or numbers, and make sure it is not something easily guessable (i.e spouses name).</p><p>6. After you finish the form click Next Step and, in the next screen, Continue to YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel"></a>Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel</h2><h4 id="1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love"><a href="#1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose a Topic you Love"></a>1. Choose a Topic you Love</h4><p>When choosing a topic for your YouTube channel make sure you pick something you are passionate about. If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p><h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose a Great Name"></a>3. Choose a Great Name</h4><p>Picking a great name for your YouTube account can take a lot of effort. Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p><p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule"></a>4. Make a Schedule</h4><p>Maintaining a YouTube channel is a big time commitment. You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like. They are more likely to subscribe and tune in for every post if they are given a chance to anticipate when your new entry is coming.</p><h4 id="5-Take-Inventory"><a href="#5-Take-Inventory" class="headerlink" title="5. Take Inventory"></a>5. Take Inventory</h4><p>Think about what equipment you have that you can use for your YouTube channel. The only thing you absolutely cannot get by without is a decent camera, but there are other types of equipment that it is a good idea to have too. Lights, a tripod, an external microphone – these are all things that a lot of YouTubers find they need in order to produce great videos. If you do not have these things, or money you are prepared to invest in them, then you will need to find ways around them until your situation changes.

There are 25 pieces of sound effect available in Filmora, such as transition swoosh, cinematic horn, beep sound and phone ring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-sound-effects-audio-library.jpg"                      alt="Sound Effects in Filmora9 video editor"                ></p><p>If you do not see the sound effect you want in Filmora, you can also go to the online effect store to find out more sound effects. The sounds are in.wav or mp3 files, so you do not have to use them inside Filmora only. They’re free to use for everyone after downloading, no matter what video editor you use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmstock-sound-effect.jpg"                      alt="Sound Effects in Filmstock effects store"                ></p><p>The Filmstock audio effect library covers sound effects in different categories: nature sounds, animal sounds, movie sounds, gun sounds, fireworks, bird sounds, cricket sounds, wet sounds, dog barking, water sounds, guitar sounds, city sounds, monster sounds, laughing sounds, dinosaur sounds, fart sounds, pet sounds, dog sounds, car sounds, video game, and thunderstorm.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Freesound"><a href="#2-Freesound" class="headerlink" title="2.

Freesound</h4><p>Sounds on Freesound are uploaded by users under various Creative Commons licenses (some may require attribution, some may not allow commercial use).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freesound-sound-effect.jpg"                      alt="Sound Effects in Freesound"                ></p><p>The easiest way to browse the sounds on Freesound is probably to click into Sounds in the top menu, and then ‘Browse tags’ in the menu on the right of your screen. All of the tags on the site will be displayed, and the most commonly used ones will be biggest. The tags include what the sounds are meant to be (i.e. percussion or thunder) and what type of sounds they are (i.e. field-recording or synth).</p><h4 id="3-PacDV"><a href="#3-PacDV" class="headerlink" title="3. PacDV"></a>3. PacDV</h4><p>PacDV has been producing sound effects since 2001. You can browse and download sounds individually from their site, or download all at once in a huge bundle. You can use all the sounds for free (you just can’t sell them or provide direct download links to other people).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pacdv-sound-effect.jpg"                      alt="Sound Effects in PacDV"                ></p><p>On the left of the website there’s a menu where you can choose what kinds of sound effects you’re interested in. The categories are:</p><p> <strong>Ambience:</strong>  this is where you’ll find general background sounds, like ‘car interior’ or ‘grocery store’. Even when nothing in particular is happening, locations have sounds. This is also where you’ll find things like crowd noises.</p><p> <strong>Domestic:</strong>  these are sounds you hear around the home, like sounds related to doors and appliances.</p><p> <strong>Interfaces:</strong>  a lot of tech sounds live here, like beeps and clicks. Beeps are all titled ‘Beep’, but nothing else is really labeled beyond being called ‘Interface Sound’. You just have to listen and find out.</p><p> <strong>Machines:</strong>  a variety of different machine sounds can be found here, from power tools like chainsaws and drills to things like typewriters or paper shredders.</p><p> <strong>Mechanical:</strong>  this is where you’ll find sounds associated with cameras, coin slots, zippers, and more.</p><p> <strong>People:</strong>  laughing, clapping, footsteps and even farts – this is where you’ll find human sounds.</p><p> <strong>Transportation:</strong>  these sounds are all related to vehicles, be they cars or airplanes.</p><p> <strong>Voices:</strong>  here you’ll find voices saying common things like ‘hi’, ‘aaah’, or ‘come on’.</p><p> <strong>Music:</strong>  PacDV also has a selection of royalty free music. If you use it in your video, you need to give them credit by including Music by &lt;<a class="link"   href="http://www.pacdv.com/sounds/%3E" >www.pacdv.com/sounds/&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your video description.</p><p> <strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> sounds that don’t quite fit into other categories.</p><h4 id="4-Sound-Bible"><a href="#4-Sound-Bible" class="headerlink" title="4. Sound Bible"></a>4. Sound Bible</h4><p>The sounds on Sound Bible are either in the public domain, which means anyone can use them for anything without restriction, or licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License, which means you just need to provide a credit for the person who created the effect you use. When you click on sound effects on Sound Bible you’ll be able to see whether the effect is Public Domain or Attribution 3.0, and it will tell you who the sound was recorded by. Both public domain and Attribution 3.0 sounds are available for commercial use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/soundbible-free-sound-effect.jpg"                      alt="Sound Effects in Sound Bible"                ></p><p>This site has a search function, so if you want dog sounds you can search for ‘dog’. This might be easier than trying to pick the category closest to what you’re looking for and just scrolling through, like you do on some sites.</p><p>Sound Bible is updated about 3 times a week, so you can always check back for fresh sounds.</p><h4 id="5-Sound-Gator"><a href="#5-Sound-Gator" class="headerlink" title="5. Sound Gator"></a>5. Sound Gator</h4><p>Sound Gator has a huge number of sound effects divided into too many categories to list (24). The categories tend to be very specific, like ‘drink sound effects’ or ‘phone sound effects. If you don’t see a category that sounds like what you’re looking for, make sure to check under Misc Sound Effects because there are 68 Mp3#s in there for everything from tools to static.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/soundgator-free-sound-effect.jpg"                      alt="Sound Gator Free Sound Effects"                ></p><p>You can sort the sound effects on Sound Gator by date added, popularity, top rated, runtime, top favorites, or most discussed.</p><h4 id="6-Sounds-Crate"><a href="#6-Sounds-Crate" class="headerlink" title="6.

Zapsplat"></a>7. Zapsplat</h4><p>Zapsplat claims to be the fastest growing free sound effects library on the internet. With more than 23,999 professional sounds, and more being added every week, they might just be right. The owner of the site, Alan McKinney, adds 500 sound effects every week by himself and the site also accepts sounds from contributors. All of their sounds were recorded using professional equipment and then edited to make them perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zapsplat-sound-effect-categories.jpg"                      alt="Zapsplat Crate Sound Effect Categories"                ></p><p>You can even send Alan a message and request specific sound effects if you can’t already find what you want on the site.</p><p>On Zapsplat you can browse 26 categories including fantasy, warfare, and animals for individual sounds. Or, you can visit the Free SFX Packs section and download a set of related sounds together. Packs include ‘Magic Wand’, ‘Science Fiction Alarms’, and ‘Cartoon Boings’.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-Your-Own-Sound-Effects-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Make-Your-Own-Sound-Effects-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make Your Own Sound Effects for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 2: Make Your Own Sound Effects for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Here are some easy ways you can make your own sound effects at home.</p><h4 id="1-Making-Natural-Sounds"><a href="#1-Making-Natural-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="1. Making Natural Sounds"></a>1. Making Natural Sounds</h4><p> <strong>Fire</strong>  using cellophane. Just crinkle the cellophane wrap to create a sound like a crackling fire. Chip bags work too.</p><p> <strong>Rain</strong>  using rice. Sprinkle rice (or birdseed) onto a thin metal sheet.</p><p>Alternatively for rain, you could record the sound of bacon frying.</p><p> <strong>Wind</strong>  using a Ziploc. Fill a large ziplock with air and then open the bag a bit and force the air out.</p><p> <strong>Thunder</strong> with aluminum. Just shake a sheet of aluminum to make a thunder sound.</p><h4 id="2-Making-Action-or-Sci-Fi-Sounds"><a href="#2-Making-Action-or-Sci-Fi-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="2. Making Action or Sci-Fi Sounds"></a>2. Making Action or Sci-Fi Sounds</h4><p> <strong>Ticking Bomb</strong>  with a clock. Any clock that ticks will do.</p><p> <strong>Hits&#x2F;Blows</strong>  with a pillow. Hit a pillow to make a sound like a body blow. For really hard hits, you might want to whack a sofa cushion with a broomstick.</p><p> <strong>Bones breaking</strong>  with celery. Just snap the celery stalks in half.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

With your audio or video clip selected, simply click the editing icon and then either Advanced (for expanded color editing options) or Customize (for the audio equalizer).</p><p>Even features like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >picture-in-picture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (PIP) and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >green screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are easy to use in Filmora. The PIP tracks are right under the main video track in your timeline. Although there is only one when you start a project, you can have up to ten. These PIP tracks can be used to layer photos and videos over top of each other. One of the most popular uses for the PIP track is facecam videos. After you drag your facecam footage into the PIP track, you can easily shrink it and move it to the corner of your main video.</p><p>The green screen has its own designated icon on the main toolbar. Simply select a clip or image in one of your PIP tracks and click it to access the feature.</p><p>Filmora is always adding new features to make editing even easier for online video creators. A few of the other tools included in Filmora are speed control, text customization, tilt-shift, ripple delete, and an audio mixer.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Part-2-Video-Editing-Software-Comparisons"><a href="#Part-2-Video-Editing-Software-Comparisons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Video Editing Software Comparisons"></a><strong>Part 2: Video Editing Software Comparisons</strong></h2><p>Here is a ‘top 4’ list of other popular video editors. The list will discuss their best features and how they measure up to Filmora.</p><h3 id="Section-1-PC-Video-Editors"><a href="#Section-1-PC-Video-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: PC Video Editors"></a><strong>Section 1: PC Video Editors</strong></h3><p>Here are two of the most popular editing programs for Windows computers:</p><h4 id="Windows-Movie-Maker"><a href="#Windows-Movie-Maker" class="headerlink" title="** Windows Movie Maker"></a>** Windows Movie Maker</h4><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker.png"                      alt="windows-movie-maker"                ></strong></p><p>Image source: intowindows</p><p>PC users can download Windows Movie Maker for free, which has made it a popular choice among video creators that are just starting out. Movie Maker has different timeline tracks for things like videos and music, and it is very easy to trim or cut up all of your media clips. The ability to sharpen some of your blurrier images, speed control, and a simple title generator, and some basic transitions are some of the program’s more noteworthy features.</p><p>Movie Maker does not come close to matching Filmora’s range of features, but it is easy to use. It could be a good option for video creators who have no room in their budget for paid software. Videos made in Movie Maker will be simple, but that is all some people need.</p><h4 id="Vegas-Movie-Studio"><a href="#Vegas-Movie-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Vegas Movie Studio"></a><strong>Vegas Movie Studio</strong></h4><p>Vegas Movie Studio, which used to be Sony Vegas, is a big step up from Movie Maker. While editing your clips, you can adjust their brightness, contrast, and color balance. On the audio side of things, Vegas has a great audio restoration tool you can use to get rid of unwanted background noises.</p><p>Although it does not have filters, overlays, and animated elements like Filmora, Vegas does have some very modern-looking titles and transition effects.</p><p>The biggest advantage that Filmora has over Vegas is that it is a lot easier to use. Vegas has some great features, but accessing and using them is not something you can just jump into doing. Filmora is so intuitive that most users can just open it up and start applying effects.</p><p>Vegas is very reasonably priced at $49.95 USD, but it is only $10 more for the ease and effect variety of Filmora.</p><h3 id="Section-2-Mac-Video-Editors"><a href="#Section-2-Mac-Video-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Mac Video Editors"></a><strong>Section 2: Mac Video Editors</strong></h3><p>Here are two of the most popular video editors for the Mac OS:</p><h4 id="iMovie"><a href="#iMovie" class="headerlink" title="iMovie"></a><strong>iMovie</strong></h4><p>iMovie comes free with Mac computers, and it is a huge step up from Windows Movie Maker. It has some really nice audio editing tools, like an equalizer and the ability to set fade in and fade out times (which Filmora also has). When you are editing video clips, iMovie provides you with a stabilization tool, speed controls, and even some filters and overlays. There are text and title options available as well, although they are very basic.</p><p>The main difference between Filmora and iMovie is variety. Filmora has a huge range of titles in different styles; iMovie has everyday fonts with all the traditional credit&#x2F;title animations. iMovie has close to the same amount of features as Filmora, but there is always less variety in those features, and they tend to feel dated.</p><p>The main difference between iMovie and every other editor on this list is the layout. The timeline is located in the top left portion of the screen, not stretched across the bottom, and the clips&#x2F;sounds do not sit in different tracks. The iMovie interface is not actually very complicated, but it will be an adjustment for anybody used to a more traditional editing experience.</p><h4 id="Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Final Cut Pro X"></a><strong>Final Cut Pro X</strong></h4><p>Final Cut Pro is Apple’s attempt at a professional-grade editing program. It is much more advanced than iMovie and offers 64-bit architecture and background rendering. Background rendering means that your imported clips are prepared for playback before you actually move them into your timeline, making the editing process a lot faster.</p><p>Final Cut Pro also boasts a huge selection of editing tools.</p><p>Like iMovie, Final Cut Pro does not use a traditional timeline. This will make it easier to learn for users upgrading from iMovie, but potentially more difficult for users coming from any other program. Final Cut Pro would be competition for Adobe Premiere if it were available on anything except the latest Mac OS.</p><p>Final Cut Pro X costs $300, making it a significant investment.</p><h3 id="Section-3-Online-Video-Editors"><a href="#Section-3-Online-Video-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Section 3: Online Video Editors"></a><strong>Section 3: Online Video Editors</strong></h3><h4 id="WeVideo"><a href="#WeVideo" class="headerlink" title="WeVideo"></a><strong>WeVideo</strong></h4><p>WeVideo is a fairly simple cloud-based video editor. Its most useful feature is that it gives your team the ability to edit collaboratively. Multiple editors can upload footage and create their own edits of the project.</p><p>WeVideo has all of the most basic editing features – the abilities to trim clips, add transitions, and give your project a soundtrack. Other than the potential for collaboration, though, it has nothing that free programs like iMovie, and even Windows Movie Maker, do not have.</p><p>There are a few different pricing options for WeVideo. You can use it for free, but your storage space and the number of features you have access to will be very limited. Your videos will also be watermarked. Also, both the free and $19 packages limit your video resolution to 720p. You will need to pay at least $39 for 1080p, and it will cost you $69 to get rid of all the storage limits.</p><p>If you are going to pay $69 for video editing software, you are much better off using Filmora.</p><h3 id="Section-4-The-Pro-Choice"><a href="#Section-4-The-Pro-Choice" class="headerlink" title="Section 4: The Pro-Choice"></a><strong>Section 4: The Pro-Choice</strong></h3><h4 id="Adobe-Premiere"><a href="#Adobe-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="Adobe Premiere"></a><strong>Adobe Premiere</strong></h4><p>Adobe Premiere is a professional editing software. In terms of functionality, it has every program on this list, including Filmora, beat. It has very powerful video and audio editing tools, and the program can be customized to suit the needs of particular projects.</p><p>Because it is designed for professionals and veteran editors, Premiere is far from a simple program. If you have not edited a video before, or are used to a simpler program, it will take you a long time to become good at using Premiere (it might be a good idea to find an online course).</p><p>It does have a few features designed to save time, such as an automatic audio syncing tool and the ability to apply changes you have made to one clip across multiple other clips. The Premiere is probably the best program for professional video editors, but Filmora’s ease of use gives it an edge with amateur video creators.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Filmora is the best video editing software for YouTubers and other online video creators. Windows Movie Maker and iMovie are decent basic programs for creators on a budget, and Premiere is an excellent program for professionals, but if your goal is to create awesome videos for YouTube, then Filmora is the best tool for the job.</p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>. It provides special effects, stock photo &amp; video, sound library, etc., which will definitely enhance your productivity and helps to make money by making videos much accessible.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/s-exclusive-video-artwork-free-flawless-and-fast/"><u>Access Exclusive Video Artwork – Free, Flawless, and Fast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/r-your-narrative-crafting-engaging-youtube-descriptions-using-pre-set-templates/"><u>Tailor Your Narrative  Crafting Engaging YouTube Descriptions Using Pre-Set Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/outube-content-creators-optimal-stabilizer-companies-for-2024/"><u>[New] YouTube Content Creators  Optimal Stabilizer Companies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/-free-resources-to-start-a-youtube-channel/"><u>Ideal Free Resources to Start a YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ility-restored-for-youtube-shorts-post-update-for-2024/"><u>Visibility Restored for YouTube Shorts Post-Update for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-bitevideo-innovator/"><u>[Updated] BiteVideo Innovator</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/earners-guide-to-best-rated-history-yt-channels-1-10-for-2024/"><u>The Learner's Guide to Best-Rated History YT Channels #1-10 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-ftp-to-feed-the-complete-guide-to-uploading-to-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From FTP to Feed  The Complete Guide to Uploading to YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-mirthful-melodies-where-to-find-hilarious-tunes/"><u>[Updated] Mirthful Melodies  Where to Find Hilarious Tunes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/ways-to-trade-pokemon-go-from-far-away-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-proplus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Ways to trade pokemon go from far away On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G?

Are you a YouTuber looking for how to edit YouTube video with the best <strong>YouTube movie maker</strong>? You have come the right place if you wonder <strong>how to edit a video for YouTube</strong> on Windows. While, if you have free Windows Movie Maker already installed on your computer, you can edit YouTube videos in Windows Movie Maker and then upload to YouTube directly. In this article, I will show you all the information you need to know about how to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >edit a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for YouTube in Windows Movie Maker with step by step.</p><p>You may also like : <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >The Ultimate Guide to YouTube Video Editing Tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><p>In case that you do not have free Windows Movie Maker in your computer, you may need to download it from other website since Microsoft has removed the downloading link after January 2017. Please pay attention when downloading the Movie Maker application from website and never download it from untrusted website.</p><p>A better way to edit YouTube Videos - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> supports many formats including MP4, MOV, MKV, and FLV, which means that you will not need to convert the files before and after editing. Like Windows Movie Maker, Wondershare Filmora is easy to use but comes with many more features that allow for professional-grade videos. One of these features is the animated text. There are also built-in presets that you can use to quickly edit your videos. There is also the option to directly upload a video to YouTube from Filmora, so no time is wasted waiting for a video to process.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>It is hard to list all the information of how to use Filmora to edit YouTube videos here, but we have composed an article about how to edit videos, you can check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Edit Video in Filmora: Beginners’ Guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><hr><h2 id="Windows-Movie-Maker-YouTube-How-to-Edit-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Windows-Movie-Maker-YouTube-How-to-Edit-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Windows Movie Maker YouTube: How to Edit YouTube Videos?"></a>Windows Movie Maker YouTube: How to Edit YouTube Videos?</h2><p>Before editing the video in <a class="link"   href="https://windows-movie-maker-vista.en.softonic.com/download" >Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you have to make sure that the video format is supported by free Windows Movie Maker. As you may know that Window Movie Maker only accept the following file formats at importing: <strong>.WMV&#x2F;.ASF, .MPG (MPEG-1), .AVI (DV-AVI), .WMA, .WAV, and .MP3.</strong> Importing formats such as   <strong>MP4&#x2F;3GP, FLV and MOV,</strong> are also supported you are running Windows 7 or later and you have installed the necessary codec as well.</p><p>If your videos are not supported at importing in Windows Movie Maker, you may need to converter it first or choose a video editor like Filmora video editor which supports the almost all popular formats.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Import-Video-Files-Into-Windows-Movie-Maker"><a href="#Step-1-Import-Video-Files-Into-Windows-Movie-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Import Video Files Into Windows Movie Maker"></a>Step 1: Import Video Files Into Windows Movie Maker</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-clips-in-wmm.png"                      alt="youtube movie maker import video"                ></p><p>To import video or photo into Windows Movie Maker, you can click on the button <strong>Add Videos or Photos</strong> located at the top of the program.

You need to select the clip, and add the transition that you want. The program does the rest of the work. You can see how it looks by clicking play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-wmm.jpg"                      alt="youtube movie maker to add transition"                ></p><p>Applying visual effects, overlays and filters work in the same way, but you click on <strong>Visual Effects</strong>, which is located at the top of the window. You can apply effects to any clip as along as the clip is selected first.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Edit-Mute-Audio-in-Video-or-Add-New-Audio-Sound"><a href="#Step-4-Edit-Mute-Audio-in-Video-or-Add-New-Audio-Sound" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Edit&#x2F;Mute Audio in Video or Add New Audio Sound"></a>Step 4: Edit&#x2F;Mute Audio in Video or Add New Audio Sound</h4><p>If you are planning on adding music to your video, you should think about muting the audio in video or decrease the audio volume in Video. Double click the video clip to enter the Edit panel, and then then click on <strong>Video Volume</strong>  button. You can then mute the audio by drag the volume slider to the left end. Of course, you can adjust the video audio volume per your need. This will affect the all the sounds on that video clip. If you want to mute all the clips, you need to select all the clips, or you will end up with one clip with no sound, and the rest of the clips having sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-video-audio-windows-movie-maker.jpg"                      alt="video movie maker mute audio"                ></p><p>Once the sound has been adjusted on the clips, you can add new audio sound to the video. You can record narrations for your YouTube video in Windows Movie Maker by clicking <strong>Record narration</strong> button in Home tab and add music to video by clicking <strong>Add music</strong> button and select the music to import it. You can add music from your computer or find new music sound from AudioMicro, Vimeo or Free Music Archive online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-windows-movie-maker.jpg"                      alt="video movie maker add audio"                ></p><p>After importing the new audio file for your YouTube video, you can now adjust the music volume.

You will need to select where you want to save the file and the file type. Since we are editing videos for YouTube, choose YouTube to upload the edited video to YouTube. You can also save the video in computer with different formats, resolution or burn to DVD. Windows Movie Maker also allows you to save the Video for Email or for mobile devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker-publish-movie.jpg"                      alt="movie maker for youtube edit video"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That’s it.

They’re convenient and they draw the least amount of attention. But since most smartphones weren’t made specifically for vlogging, there’s a lot of room to make them more suitable for that purpose. Here is a list of the nine best smartphone camera accessories for vloggers.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Table of Contents 1. <a href="#portablecharger">PORTABLE CHARGER</a>2. <a href="#tripodmount">TRIPOD MOUNT</a>3. <a href="#antigravitycase">ANTI-GRAVITY CASE</a>4. <a href="#selfieringlight">SELFIE RING LIGHT</a>5. <a href="#directionalmic">DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONE</a>6. <a href="#lensset">LENS SET</a>7. <a href="#filmmakingrig01">FILMMAKING RIG</a>8. <a href="#filmmakingrig02">FILMMAKING RIG</a>9. <a href="#gimbal">GIMBAL</a></th></tr></thead></table><h3 id="1-RAVPower-Portable-Charger"><a href="#1-RAVPower-Portable-Charger" class="headerlink" title="1.

If you’re planning to vlog all throughout your day with your phone, you need a portable way to charge it back up. RAVPower has a great line up of portable chargers with multiple USB inputs that hold a total charge of more than 20,000 mAh. With that amount, you can fully charge your smartphone more than 6 times! I own one myself and it’s been great for me during my travels. A 22,000 mAh charger goes for about $42 USD.</p><h3 id="2-Arkon-Tripod-Mount"><a href="#2-Arkon-Tripod-Mount" class="headerlink" title="2. Arkon Tripod Mount"></a>2. Arkon Tripod Mount</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/best-smartphone-camera-accessories-tripod-mount.jpg"                      alt="Arkon Tripod Mount"                ></p><p>The Arkon tripod mount is a great portable tripod option that you can get at the fair price of around $20 USD. Not only does it have bendable legs, like the more expensive Joby GorillaPod tripod, that you can wrap around all kinds of structures, but it also comes with the smartphone mount, which Joby sells separately. Another great thing about the Arkon tripod is that its smartphone mount can be rotated so that you can position your phone to film in either widescreen or portrait mode.</p><h3 id="3-Mega-Tiny-Anti-Gravity-Case"><a href="#3-Mega-Tiny-Anti-Gravity-Case" class="headerlink" title="3. Mega Tiny Anti-Gravity Case"></a>3. Mega Tiny Anti-Gravity Case</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-anti-gravity-case.jpg"                      alt="Mega Tiny Anti-Gravity Case"                ></p><p>For all the flat surfaces that the bendable legs of the Arkon tripod mount can’t wrap around, Mega Tiny’s anti-gravity cases will do the job of holding your iPhone or Android phone in one fixed position. These cases can stick to glass, mirrors, metal, and more. They range from $20 to $30 USD.</p><h3 id="4-FLII-Selfie-Ring-Light"><a href="#4-FLII-Selfie-Ring-Light" class="headerlink" title="4. FLII Selfie Ring Light"></a>4. FLII Selfie Ring Light</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-selfie-ring-light.jpg"                      alt="FLII Selfie Ring Light"                ></p><p>As much as smartphone camera technology has advanced, phone cameras still underperform when it comes to filming video in low-light. In low-light, your footage is very grainy because your phone is equipped with a small camera sensor, an engineering choice by the manufacturers to keep the size of the phone small. A handy accessory that you can use to get more light is the FLII selfie ring light. This ring light clamps onto your phone and emits a neutral white light. You can clamp this light to either side of your phone, depending on whether you want to use your rear-facing camera or your front-facing camera. This selfie ring light sells for around $16 USD.</p><h3 id="5-RODE-VideoMic-Me"><a href="#5-RODE-VideoMic-Me" class="headerlink" title="5. RODE VideoMic Me"></a>5. RODE VideoMic Me</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-microphone.jpg"                      alt="RODE VideoMic Me"                ></p><p>The mic that is already built into your phone is equally sensitive to the sounds that come from behind the phone as it is to the sounds that are in front of the phone. This can be problematic when you’re trying to vlog in selfie mode while there’s a loud concert on the other side. One smartphone accessory that can improve the sound that you record from your phone in these situations is the RODE VideoMic Me. This mini directional shotgun mic plugs right into your phone’s headphone jack and sells for around $60 USD. In windy conditions, the dead cat windshield that it comes with does a great job of minimizing noise from the wind. In quiet, indoor conditions where you are the only person speaking, this device performs no better than your phone’s internal microphone. Your phone will also have to be in airplane mode to prevent the Rode VideoMic Me from recording unwanted clicking noise caused by background processes performed by your phone. So you wouldn’t want to use this for livestreaming.</p><h3 id="6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set"><a href="#6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set" class="headerlink" title="6. Aukey Optic 3-in-1 Smartphone Lens Set"></a>6. Aukey Optic 3-in-1 Smartphone Lens Set</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-smartphone-lens-set.jpg"                      alt="Aukey Optic 3-in-1 Smartphone Lens Set"                ></p><p>Aukey makes a 3-in-1 lens set that you can clamp onto your smartphone so that you can vlog at different focal lengths. The 3-in-1 set comes with a wide-angle lens, a fisheye lens, and a macro lens. The clamp it comes with is long enough for these lenses to reach any camera on a smartphone, not just those of iPhones which are positioned close to the phone’s outer edge. To get the most out of these lenses, you’ll have to use them without your phone’s protective case on. Although you are free to use this lens set on either your phone’s rear-facing camera or front-facing camera, the metal housing of these lenses is likely to show up in your footage when you use them with your front-facing camera. So, instead of having your recorded image stretch to the ends of a 16:9 ratio rectangular frame, your recorded image will look as if it is contained inside a circle. This lens set sells for around $30 USD.</p><h3 id="7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone"><a href="#7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone"></a>7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-iographer-go.jpg"                      alt="iOgrapher Go"                ></p><p>There’s many more accessories that you can take advantage of if you don’t limit yourself to just smartphone camera accessories. Sound and lighting equipment made for stand-alone cameras perform much better too. Many of these accessories are meant to connect to the camera “shoe” (a bracket on top of the camera that accessories can be attached to). Smartphones don’t come with these kinds of shoes. So, to take advantage of these higher quality accessories, you’ll need some kind of camera rig for your smartphone that also comes with shoes. The iOgrapher Go offers this at around $60 USD. This accessory comes with three shoes.</p><h3 id="8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System"><a href="#8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System" class="headerlink" title="8. Manfrotto TwistGrip System"></a>8. Manfrotto TwistGrip System</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-twist-grip-system.jpg"                      alt="Manfrotto TwistGrip System"                ></p><p>Manfrotto’s TwistGrip System does a similar job to the above iOgrapher Go. This system also comes with three shoes. An advantage the TwistGrip System has over the iOgrapher Go is that it is much more portable. Its three connected parts can be detached to take up less space in your bag. This system sells for around $50 USD.</p><h3 id="9-Zhiyun-Smooth-Q-3-Axis-Handheld-Gimbal-Stabilizer-for-Smartphones"><a href="#9-Zhiyun-Smooth-Q-3-Axis-Handheld-Gimbal-Stabilizer-for-Smartphones" class="headerlink" title="9.

What is the way to mark different parts of the videos, and how can you add markers to all the existing videos on YouTube? Don’t worry; this article will discuss everything about YouTube chapters that you need to know. Keep reading to find all the details and learn the step-by-step instructions to add chapters to your YouTube videos for better engagement.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Are YouTube Chapters?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Add Chapter to YouTube Video Progress Bar?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Why Add Chapters to Videos?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: When Add Chapters on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Will Chapter Decrease Watching Time?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: Video Chapter Adding Tips</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Part 7: Why YouTube Chapter is Not Working?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-YouTube-Chapters"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-YouTube-Chapters" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Are YouTube Chapters?"></a>Part 1: What Are YouTube Chapters?</h2><p>YouTube video chapters are an excellent way to optimize your YouTube content. When you have chapters for your YouTube video, each chapter will have an individual preview. Chapters will break your YouTube video into multiple parts allowing your audience to have better context and information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-chapter.jpg"                      alt="YouTube video chpater"                ></p><p>As per YouTube, chapters let the audience navigate better through videos. Chapters will let your audience watch different video parts, which will eventually lead to better engagement. If you want to organize your YouTube content, chapters are one of the best ways to go about it. By using labeled timestamps, your video will be divided into multiple sections. Your audience will be able to see the preview of the content and easily skip to the part they want to see within the video’s progress bar.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Chapter-to-YouTube-Video-Progress-Bar"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Chapter-to-YouTube-Video-Progress-Bar" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Chapter to YouTube Video Progress Bar?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Chapter to YouTube Video Progress Bar?</h2><p>If you are a YouTube creator and want to know how you can add chapters to your YouTube content, here’s what you need to do. Follow these instructions carefully:</p><p>Step 1: First things first, please sign in to your YouTube account.</p><p>Step 2: Select the video that you want to edit and add chapters.</p><p>Step 3: Click on the edit video option. This option will be there under the video.</p><p>Step 4: On the add details page, you will see the description box. Here, you need to add the list of titles and timestamps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-chapter-youtube-description.jpg"                      alt="add YouTube video chpater"                ></p><p>Please keep in mind that you must add the first timestamp with “00:00”. You will have to add a minimum of three timestamps with a minimum of 10 seconds for each chapter. Here is how it looks like in the description after published.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-chapter-description-appearance.jpg"                      alt="Chapters in YouTube video description"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Why-YouTubers-Should-Add-Chapters-to-videos"><a href="#Part-3-Why-YouTubers-Should-Add-Chapters-to-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why YouTubers Should Add Chapters to videos?"></a>Part 3: Why YouTubers Should Add Chapters to videos?</h2><p>There are two primary advantages of adding chapters to your YouTube videos. Apart from making your YouTube video look organized and neat, chapters will let you provide a better user experience to everyone watching your video because they will find all the information about your video faster and easier within a video. And the second benefit is that your YouTube video will show up in search results. This is a way to optimize your content for more users to find your content.</p><p>YouTube chapters are beneficial for both creators and viewers. On the progress bar, these clickable chapters can be added. This will allow a viewer to skip and scrub through a video quickly and skip to parts they actually want to watch.</p><p>This feature is quite helpful for videos that are pretty long. Chapters will let you segment the videos into important chapters so that the viewer can rewatch already watched chapters or skip to other chapters in the video. YouTube chapters have been recently added to this platform for better navigation and engagement.</p><p><strong>Better User Experience for Users</strong></p><p>Just like Google wants browsers to find what they are looking for when they add a keyword, YouTube also wants to help viewers find what they are looking for. Chapters can be immensely beneficial for extended content. For example, if you are uploading a video of your convert video, let the users jump straight to their favorite songs.</p><p>Even in tutorial video content, viewers will now have a chance to get straight to the main part of the video. With chapters being added, viewers will have an opportunity to decide whether they want to watch the whole video or not. They won’t have to keep skipping one part to another blindly. Chapters will allow them to find what they are looking for in an instant.</p><p><strong>For Creators: Increased Visibility</strong></p><p>If you know about the Google algorithm, you must be aware that it regularly changes its algorithm to let people find the information they are looking for easily. Adding chapters to your video will encourage Google to display them more often when someone searches for them, and this will include adding your videos to its featured snippets.</p><p>While adding chapters, you need to make sure that it is labeled with correct keywords, and it is clear and descriptive. YouTube videos are often showed as Google snippet when someone tries to find something on the search engine. Adding a chapter will let Google understand the content better, thereby letting your videos gain more search traffic.</p><h2 id="Part-4-When-should-I-add-or-not-chapters-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-4-When-should-I-add-or-not-chapters-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: When should I add or not chapters on YouTube?"></a>Part 4: When should I add or not chapters on YouTube?</h2><p>If you are wondering whether all videos on YouTube should have chapters, the answer to this is no. A two minutes long video won’t require chapters because it won’t make sense. Think about whether you would want your audience to have reduced watch time. Another thing to pay attention to is audience retention.</p><p>We mentioned earlier that adding chapters to long videos will be a good idea, but before you jump in and start adding chapters, you need to understand whether it will help you and should be done in your particular case?</p><p>If you are uploading a video on education, science and technology, how-to, news and politics, Q and A, and other similar videos, adding chapters will definitely help. In these kinds of videos, you will let your audience rewatch a section they liked the most over and over again.</p><p>However, if you are uploading music, entertainment, comedy, and film and animation videos, we will recommend not to add chapters because this will reduce the watch time.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Do-YouTube-Video-Chapters-Decrease-Channel-Watch-Time"><a href="#Part-5-Do-YouTube-Video-Chapters-Decrease-Channel-Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Do YouTube Video Chapters Decrease Channel Watch Time?"></a>Part 5: Do YouTube Video Chapters Decrease Channel Watch Time?</h2><p>One of the most commonly asked questions regarding adding chapters to YouTube videos is whether it will reduce the watch time of a video. Video chapters are a pretty good feature and can enable your videos to engage with the viewers.</p><p>Since chapters allow your audience to skip through video content, they are not really watching the whole video, which can’t be suitable for audience retention! Here’s what we have to say to this: don’t put your 100% focus on watch time right now. Your focus should be creating informative and engaging content, which will keep your audience hooked to their screens. Even if you add chapters, if your audience doesn’t find it engaging, they will choose not to go on with the content.</p><p>Video chapters are a tiny part of the overall content. Chapters provide value to your audience, and you should try them. If you are uploading a concise video, animation video, funny video, and more, don’t add chapters.</p><p>Even some of the most watched videos on YouTube have chapters. Learn from them. These video makers could have thought about numbers rather than giving value to their audience, but they did just the opposite, and here they are with over a million views!</p><h2 id="Part-6-Tips-for-adding-chapters-to-YouTube-video"><a href="#Part-6-Tips-for-adding-chapters-to-YouTube-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Tips for adding chapters to YouTube video"></a>Part 6: Tips for adding chapters to YouTube video</h2><p>Each video on YouTube is different, and that’s why there is no one-size-fits-all answer. There are some cases where you should not think about adding chapters at all. Whereas in other cases, you will have to experiment a bit before adding chapters.</p><p>Here are some tips that will help you.</p><p><strong>Do Some Testing</strong></p><p>Before adding chapters to a new video that you are thinking to upload, try adding chapters to an old video. See what happens to that video. Have the views increased? How about average view duration? Track these metrics first, and then try adding chapters to your upcoming videos to benefit from videos. Along with these metrics, you will also have to evaluate if adding chapters decreases or increases the watch time and number of views.</p><p><strong>Label Your Chapters Using Keywords</strong></p><p>Another thing to do that will help you have better traction is using a good keyword strategy. Look at what people are using while searching for content, which is similar to yours? Using names based on keywords that have better search volume will help your videos to rank higher.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Why-Video-Chapter-is-Not-working-Problem-solved"><a href="#Part-7-Why-Video-Chapter-is-Not-working-Problem-solved" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Why Video Chapter is Not working? [Problem solved]"></a>Part 7: Why Video Chapter is Not working? [Problem solved]</h2><p>There are a few mandatory things that you need to do before adding chapters to your YouTube video. Here are some of the common reasons why the video chapter is not working. See if any one of them is true in your case, and rectify it right away.</p><ul><li>Your video doesn’t have the 00:00 timestamp.</li><li>Your video has less than three chapters.</li><li>You have added a chapter that is less than 10 seconds long.</li><li>You have not added the timestamps in chronological order.</li><li>Rather than using “:” you have entered “.” for timecodes.</li><li>If your channel has active copyright strikes, video chapters won’t work.</li><li>Your channel doesn’t have more than 1k subscribers.</li><li>Your video chapters are not suitable for some viewers.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-enhancing-user-interaction-with-well-sized-thumbnails/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing User Interaction with Well-Sized Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ffect-filmmaking-youtubes-guide-to-green-magic/"><u>Eco-Effect Filmmaking  YouTube's Guide to Green Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-exclusive-8-high-youtube-viewership-observer/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Exclusive 8-High YouTube Viewership Observer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-understanding-your-earning-potential-youtubes-latest-rules/"><u>2024 Approved  Understanding Your Earning Potential - YouTube's Latest Rules</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-breakthrough-techniques-for-outstanding-youtube-openers-technique-1plus2/"><u>In 2024, Breakthrough Techniques for Outstanding YouTube Openers (Technique 1+2)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/st-vr-videos-on-youtube-to-have-immersive-experience/"><u>10 Best VR Videos on YouTube to Have Immersive Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/omparing-youtube-and-dailymotion-notable-contrasts/"><u>[New] Comparing YouTube and Dailymotion  Notable Contrasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/omparison-game-youtube-against-dailymention/"><u>The Comparison Game  YouTube Against DailyMention</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-imei-unlokers-for-iphone-14-plus-and-android-phones-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top IMEI Unlokers for iPhone 14 Plus and Android Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/top-5-dynamic-visual-identity-examples-in-social-space-for-2024/"><u>Top 5 Dynamic Visual Identity Examples in Social Space for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/x-stream-recorder-pc-edition-for-2024/"><u>X-Stream Recorder PC Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-insights-into-magix-video-pro-xs-design/"><u>2024 Approved  Expert Insights Into Magix Video Pro X's Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-record-video-directly-from-webcam-using-vlc-media-player/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Record Video Directly From Webcam Using VLC Media Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/find-my-app-troubleshooting-no-location-found-vs-location-not-available-and-how-to-fix-them-on-apple-iphone-13-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Find My App Troubleshooting No Location Found vs. Location Not Available & How to Fix Them On Apple iPhone 13 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-eye-on-your-instagram-disconnectors/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Eye on Your Instagram Disconnectors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/shade-adjustments-simplified-learn-with-these-11-guides/"><u>Shade Adjustments Simplified - Learn with These 11 Guides</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-contacts-from-honor-x50-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>How to recover deleted contacts from Honor X50.</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

All you need to do to access it is, sign in to your Google account, tap the <strong>+</strong> button at the bottom, and tap <strong>Create a Short</strong> in the popup box that comes up.</p><ol><li><strong>What if YouTube Shorts is not showing on my YouTube app?</strong></li></ol><p>Make sure that your YouTube app is updated to its latest version. If the app is already updated, and <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is still unavailable, the chances are that Google hasn’t rolled the app in your region. Since <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is still in its Beta phase, only the region of India can use all the functions of the app at the time of this writing. In such a case, you are suggested to wait until the <strong>YouTube Shorts app</strong> is made available for your location.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the YouTube Shorts video duration?</strong></li></ol><p>A <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> video can be of only up to 60 seconds.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the YouTube Shorts size limitation?</strong></li></ol><p>YouTube hasn’t provided any information related to this as of now. However, you can rest assure that a 60 seconds long video file wouldn’t be too large for YouTube to handle.</p><ol><li><strong>How many subs do you need to access Shorts?</strong></li></ol><p><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is available for everyone regardless of the number of subscribers the channel has.</p><ol><li><strong>Can you make money on Shorts?</strong></li></ol><p>Unfortunately, NO. Although you cannot monetize the recordings published as <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong>, they can be a good source to drive subscribers to your main YouTube channel that may have the videos that can be monetized.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/nobstructed-movie-magic-erasing-youtube-borders-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unobstructed Movie Magic  Erasing YouTube Borders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-strategies-to-increase-views-via-thumbnails/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Strategies to Increase Views via Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-overcoming-dark-pixels-in-online-video-platform/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Overcoming Dark Pixels in Online Video Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-optimize-your-youtube-videos-faster-rendering-smarter-uploads/"><u>In 2024, Optimize Your YouTube Videos  Faster Rendering, Smarter Uploads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-ramp-up-visibility-strategies-for-engaging-shorts-on-youtub/"><u>In 2024, Ramp Up Visibility  Strategies for Engaging Shorts on YouTub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-incredible-trend-trackers-monitor-highest-youtube-spots/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Incredible Trend Trackers  Monitor Highest YouTube Spots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-mastering-youtube-shorts-for-profit-essential-requirements-and-potential-earnings/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Youtube Shorts for Profit  Essential Requirements and Potential Earnings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-harnessing-the-power-of-asynchronous-programming-in-javascript/"><u>[New] In 2024, Harnessing the Power of Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-ryans-wealth-wonders-a-kids-fortune-in-the-streaming-space-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Ryan’s Wealth Wonders  A Kid's Fortune in the Streaming Space for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-decoding-why-your-facebook-messages-dont-share-videos-androidios/"><u>2024 Approved  Decoding Why Your Facebook Messages Don't Share Videos (Android/iOS)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/unlock-your-full-potential-with-zd-softwares-advanced-screenshot-techniques-for-2024/"><u>Unlock Your Full Potential with ZD Software's Advanced Screenshot Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-infinix-note-30-vip-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Infinix Note 30 VIP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-increase-views-discover-20-prime-thumbnail-fonts/"><u>In 2024, Increase Views - Discover 20 Prime Thumbnail Fonts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-blitz-through-edits-with-windows-11-pro-tips/"><u>In 2024, Blitz Through Edits with Windows 11 Pro Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-undelete-lost-music-from-nokia-c210-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - Undelete Lost Music from Nokia C210</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-best-websites-to-download-ding-sound-effect-easily/"><u>In 2024, 10 Best Websites to Download Ding Sound Effect Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/remote-classroom-video-archive-for-2024/"><u>Remote Classroom Video Archive for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/in-2024-11-best-location-changers-for-motorola-edge-40-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 11 Best Location Changers for Motorola Edge 40 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/about-sony-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/"><u>About Sony FRP Bypass</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
