However, the <strong>YouTube view monetization programs are</strong> not that clear. Most people don’t even know how YouTube monetization views work. How many views on YouTube do you need to start making money from your content on the platform? Some people have even been made to believe the common misconception that views alone determine the amount of money a YouTuber earns. Let’s have a look at what entails views for YouTube monetization and the factors that affect your earnings on the platform.</p><p><strong>YouTube Channel Grower</strong> A cross-platform for enhancing and editing YouTube videos for more engagement!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money"></a><strong>Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money</strong></h2><p>Despite a lot of people seeking a successful career on YouTube, only a handful make it big on the platform. Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views. Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View"></a><strong>Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels. The actual revenue will depend on several factors.</p><ul><li><a href="#factor1">Factors Affecting Earnings per View</a></li><li><a href="#factor2">YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</a></li><li><a href="#factor3">Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</a></li><li><a href="#factor4">Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</a></li></ul><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting Earnings per View"></a><strong>Factors Affecting Earnings per View</strong></h3><p>The amount of money YouTubers make per view is affected by various factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ad Revenue Rates</strong>: The rates vary depending on the country where viewers are located, the time of the year, and the ad your YouTube channel is running.</li><li><strong>Audience Demographics</strong>: Advertisers usually pay more to show their ads to viewers in some demographics, especially those who are interested in specific products or have a high income.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: Videos with high CTR and AVD earn more income from ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time</strong>: YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time earn more money.</li></ul><h3 id="YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model"><a href="#YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model"></a><strong>YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</strong></h3><p>The YouTibe’s revenue-sharing model determines how much creators are paid. The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers. This is because viewers will be engaged for longer periods, increasing their chances of viewing the ad.</li></ul><h3 id="Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube"><a href="#Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Other Revenue Streams on YouTube"></a><strong>Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</strong></h3><p>You can earn a lot more per 1,000 views by influencing your viewers to buy products even before your channel gets monetized. Other ways of making money on YouTube include</p><ul><li>Selling branded merch or courses</li><li>YouTube Premium subscriber’s subscription fee</li><li>Recurring monthly payments by members for special benefits</li><li>Highlight fan’s messages in chat streams</li><li>Sponsorships by partnering with brands to promote their products or services</li><li>Affiliate marketing</li><li>Brand deals</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Editing-YouTube-Videos-for-YouTube-Monetization-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Editing-YouTube-Videos-for-YouTube-Monetization-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

In this article, we will teach you about some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video formats and settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>To upload a video to YouTube you have to make sure that you are using one of the video file formats that is supported by the platform itself. Here they are:</p><p>  - MP4</p><p> - MOV</p><p> - AVI</p><p> - FLV</p><p> - 3GPP</p><p> - WMV</p><p> - WebM</p><p> - MPEGS</p><p> <strong>YouTube recommends uploading your videos as MP4 files.</strong> Some benefits of MP4s are that the files are not as large as AVIs, they provide better quality than FLVs, and they often display with the same quality or better as you would get watching the video on a native video player. Other file formats like 3GPP and MPEG-PS generally have resolutions too small for high-resolution tablets or desktop devices.</p><p>If your phone or video editing software does not output MP4 videos, consider getting video editing software or a conversion program that can (like Filmora Video Editor).</p><p>Filmora is an easy-to-use video editing program that can export to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, F4V, MKV, TS, 3GP, MPEG-2, WEBM, GIF, and MP3. You can convert a video to an MP4 simply by importing it into Filmora, dragging it into the timeline, and exporting it in the MP4 format.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube"><a href="#The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Best Upload Settings for YouTube"></a>The Best Upload Settings for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The best video code:</strong></p><p><strong>The best video format:</strong> MP4</p><p>Audio should be produced using the LC format and stereo 5.1 or standard stereo. You can upload separate MP3 audio format files for voiceovers if you need to.</p><p>The aspect ratio for a video should be 16:9 so that it won’t have black bars on the side when uploaded to YouTube. YouTube has also made it possible for 9:16 (portrait) style videos to be viewed without black bars, full screen, using their iOS app.</p><p>You should export in at least 30 frames per second. Many creators push that to 60 frames per second, which is better for most types of videos (although it may not make a noticeable difference for others).</p><p>The maximum size for quick upload and load time on YouTube is generally under 2gb. Luckily MP4 offers a great degree of compression without sacrificing too much image quality.</p><p>If you scale down the file size of the video by reducing the resolution or choosing a format with more compression, that can cause you to lose quality. If you need a smaller file, it’s always better to scale down the length of a video rather than continually compress the file or lose frames from the video.</p><p>Although a 2 GB file of a very long will easily upload to YouTube, it will probably be very low quality.</p><p> Do you agree that MP4 is the best video format for YouTube, or do you use something else?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a

The colors, music, and graphics you use in your intro should all be related to the theme and tone of your vlog.</p><p>Your intro is your chance to make a great first impression. A good one lets viewers know what kind of experience they can expect to have if they keep watching your video – whether it’s going to be funny or serious, for example.

There are a lot of sites that offer template videos that are either very affordable or completely free. Or, you can make your own intro in your video editing program.

Keep It Under 10 Seconds</strong></p><p>A 10-second intro should have lots of movement and exciting music to hold viewers’ attention. If your intro is more subdued then aim for more than 5 seconds.</p><p><strong>2. Support Your Brand</strong></p><p>One of the most important things your intro can do is strengthen your personal brand. Your intro should look related to your channel art and video thumbnails, but even beyond that, it should match the tone of your content.</p><p><strong>3. Use Music</strong></p><p>When there’s a silent pause in your video the chances of viewers clicking away increase. Make sure your intro includes music that suits the tone of your channel.</p><p><strong>4. Include Your Channel Name</strong></p><p>Your channel name should be a huge, prominent, visual in your intro. This may seem like a given, but there are intros out there where the channel name is either small easy to overlook, or left out completely in favor of a logo.</p><p><strong>5. Do a Cold Open</strong></p><p>On TV, shows usually have at least one scene before they play the theme song. That’s because nobody is tuning in just for the theme, or in your case the intro. Make sure you have at least a short clip before your intro to get viewers interested in the rest of your video. Beyond setting the tone for the rest of the video and introducing your topic, you can use this first clip to create a ‘curiosity gap’. This means generating curiosity and making your viewers feel invested in the video so they stay on the page.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We have listed 16 different YouTube intro makers that you can use conveniently any time you want. Some are completely free while others have limitations in free versions. You can also purchase premium templates for making your YouTube intro video stand out. Go through all of them and choose the best ones that you can use alternatively as per your requirements.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-effective-thumbnails-the-secret-to-video-success/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Effective Thumbnails The Secret to Video Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mobile-laughs-and-memes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Mobile Laughs & Memes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-411-on-building-sports-video-gold/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The 411 on Building Sports Video Gold</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/astering-channels-on-the-fly-tubebuddy-essentials/"><u>[New] Mastering Channels on the Fly - TubeBuddy Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-the-best-instagram-extractors-for-memories-saved-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Best Instagram Extractors for Memories Saved for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-boosting-your-video-income-on-youtube-essentials/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Boosting Your Video Income on Youtube - Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-from-free-to-fiscal-determining-view-counts-for-youtube-earnings/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved From Free to Fiscal Determining View Counts for YouTube Earnings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-unraveling-the-economic-power-of-mr-beast/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unraveling the Economic Power of Mr. Beast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-premium-cutters-the-8-must-have-linux-apps/"><u>[Updated] Premium Cutters The 8 Must-Have Linux Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-video-grabbers-for-windows-10-users/"><u>2024 Approved Essential Video Grabbers for Windows 10 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-helper.techidaily.com/how-to-perform-a-fresh-start-with-factory-recovery-on-your-sony-vaio-running-windows-nk/"><u>How to Perform a Fresh Start with Factory Recovery on Your Sony Vaio Running Windows Nk</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-forgotten-pin-of-your-infinix-smart-8-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Remove Forgotten PIN Of Your Infinix Smart 8 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/professional-level-photo-enhancement-on-snapchat/"><u>Professional-Level Photo Enhancement on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/remove-a05s-unlock-screen-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>Remove A05s unlock screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/unraveling-the-secrets-of-snapchat-emojis-a-quick-guide-for-users/"><u>Unraveling the Secrets of Snapchat Emojis: A Quick Guide for Users</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You must be over 18 to create an AdSense account. YouTube creators under 18 can link to the AdSense accounts of their parents or guardians.</p><p>Here’s how to sign up for AdSense through YouTube:</p><ol><li>Under <strong>Channel &gt;</strong> <strong>Status and features</strong> in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong>, look for Paid content. Click where it says <strong>‘active AdSense account’</strong>.</li><li>On the following ‘Monetization’ screen, click <strong>Next</strong> to go to AdSense.</li><li>You will be asked whether you want to use the Google account you’re already signed in to for AdSense, or if you want to use a different account.</li><li>The next step is ‘Your Website’. This will automatically be filled in with your channel. Click <strong>Accept association</strong> if it’s right.</li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> you can only have one AdSense account. Do not make a second one if you already have one. Duplicate accounts may be banned, which will stop you from monetizing your videos.</p><h2 id="What-is-Ad-Friendly-content"><a href="#What-is-Ad-Friendly-content" class="headerlink" title="What is Ad Friendly content?"></a><strong>What is Ad Friendly content?</strong></h2><p>Not all content that meets YouTube’s Community Guidelines will be considered ‘advertiser-friendly’. Companies don’t want to run ads alongside content that doesn’t match the values of their brands.</p><p>YouTube may disable ads on any video it doesn’t think is ad-friendly. Videos which may be flagged as inappropriate for ads include (but are not limited to):</p><ol><li>Videos that cover controversial or sensitive subjects.</li><li>Videos depicting the use of drugs or dangerous products.</li><li>Videos may encourage harmful or dangerous behavior.</li><li>Videos with swearing (but not ALL videos with swearing – quantity and context are factors).</li><li>Videos which contain hate speech.</li><li>Videos that depict family entertainment characters (i.e. Disney princesses) engaged in inappropriate behavior (even if you’re being satirical).</li></ol><p>If you want to make sure all of your content is advertiser-friendly, here are some best practices suggested by YouTube:</p><ol><li>Be respectful of your viewers and any people or groups you may include or mention in your video.</li><li>Extend this respectful tone to your thumbnails and video titles, and make sure your thumbnails and metadata accurately depict your video’s content.</li><li>Don’t try to monetize videos that already contain ads (i.e. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/154235" >paid product placement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2141688/17094" target="_top" id="2141688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2141688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluetties.sjv.io/i/5597632/2141688/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Get-Paid-Through-AdSense"><a href="#How-to-Get-Paid-Through-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Paid Through AdSense"></a><strong>How to Get Paid Through AdSense</strong></h2><p>In order to receive a payment from AdSense, you need to earn at least $100.</p><p>For example, if you only earn $10 in a month, you will not receive a payment that month. You will not lose that $10 – you will receive it when your total earnings reach or exceed $100.</p><p>You will also need to provide AdSense with tax information and verify your identity and address in order to start being paid.</p><p>The most popular way to get paid through AdSense is via an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer). To receive your payments this way, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><p>Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Log in to <a href="https://www.google.com/AdSense"><strong>AdSense</strong></a>.</li><li>Click <strong>Settings</strong> in the menu on the left, and then select <strong>Payments</strong>.</li><li>On the Payments page, click <strong>Manage payment options</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Add payment method</strong>.</li><li>You’ll be prompted to add your bank account details.</li><li>Make sure the name on your AdSense account matches the name on your bank account (if you’re under 18 and cannot make your own AdSense account, this may mean you’re using your parent or guardian’s bank account).</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943647/22993" target="_top" id="1943647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-YouTube-Videos-Get-the-Highest-Paying-Ads"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Videos-Get-the-Highest-Paying-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Videos Get the Highest Paying Ads?"></a><strong>Which YouTube Videos Get the Highest Paying Ads?</strong></h2><p>Not all ads pay the same, and not all videos will be able to attract the ads that pay the most.</p><p>How much money your video has the potential to earn depends on:</p><ol><li>The size of your channel</li><li>Your niche on YouTube</li><li>The specific topic of the video</li></ol><p>That the size of your channel matters probably isn’t a surprise. The biggest brands want to run their ads beside videos that are getting more views.</p><p>Whether or not your YouTube niche has a high potential for profit will depend on a couple things:</p><ol><li><strong>How many other channels are in your niche?</strong></li></ol><p>The more people there are making similar videos to you, the thinner the available ads are spread.</p><ol><li><strong>How many cheap or expensive products are being advertised in your niche?</strong></li></ol><p>If the products are free or inexpensive (i.e. free online games) then that limits your earning ability. In large niches like gaming, the few higher paying ads will go to the most popular channels and the low-paying ads will be spread amongst everyone else.</p><p>If you have a very specific niche, i.e. luxury cars, then you will have less competition and the ads available will likely be for more expensive products (and thus the ads themselves will be higher paying).</p><p>Even if you are in a large niche, you can still make videos on specific topics designed to attract higher-paying ads and more revenue. Pay attention to the analytics in your Creator Studio to learn which of your videos earn the most. Then, make more videos on similar topics to boost your earnings.</p><p>Another factor that can affect what ads appear alongside your videos is the viewing habits of individual viewers. People are shown ads that YouTube believes are more relevant to their interests.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135416/19272" target="_top" id="2135416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135416/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Useful-Terminology-CPM-CPC-CPV"><a href="#Useful-Terminology-CPM-CPC-CPV" class="headerlink" title="Useful Terminology (CPM, CPC, CPV)"></a><strong>Useful Terminology (CPM, CPC, CPV)</strong></h2><p>A lot of people think your ad revenue is determined by your view count. This isn’t true – it’s determined by ad impressions.</p><p>How much revenue you earn from the ads running around your videos depends on these three things:</p><p><strong>CPC:</strong> ‘cost per click’. Most of the ads on YouTube are CPC, meaning that an ad impression is only recorded when an ad is clicked on.</p><p><strong>CPV:</strong> ‘cost per view’. Skippable pre-roll ads are the only ads on YouTube which record ad impressions without clicks. These ads record ad impressions when viewers watch 30 seconds of the ad instead of skipping it.</p><p><strong>CPM:</strong> ‘cost per mille’ or ‘cost per thousand’. This refers to how much money gets paid out for 1000 ad impressions.</p><p>Your CPM will be affected by a multitude of things including the ads themselves and the size of your channel. AdSense has made it a rule that you cannot disclose your CPM to anyone, which makes it difficult to determine what you should expect.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> never click on ads near your own videos or instruct your viewers&#x2F;friends to do so. If your clicks are higher than what AdSense considers normal they may ban you.</p><p>Sites like <a href="https://socialblade.com/"><strong>Social Blade</strong></a> provide estimated earnings for any channel you want to look up. Looking up channels that are where you plan to be in the near future could help you set your own expectations.</p><p>Are you able to monetize your videos?

You can position your camera inside the circular space of the ring light. This kind of light also gives your eyes the circular shaped highlight that many people like to see.</td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/softbox-video-light.jpg"                      alt="Softbox Video Light"                ></td><td><strong>Softbox Video Light</strong> If you need more light and have more space, another piece of lighting equipment good for beginners is a softbox video light.</td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/umbrella-video-light.jpg"                      alt="Umbrella Video Light"                ></td><td><strong>Umbrella Video Light</strong> Umbrella video lights are very portable and affordable.

You can use YouTube algorithm Studio to calculate and give you the exact hours and days when your viewers are at bay. But again, this will only be effective if you have already gathered a substantial number of viewers. It will, therefore, not work for you if you are starting on YouTube. Usually, there isn’t enough data yet for the system to know the best time to publish, and neither know how your content performs in general.</p><p>● But all in all, you can use general practices to know when to post your content. Most likely, combine your efforts and don’t dwell on specific hours or days. Use both combined to reach as many audiences as possible.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-explore-the-best-ios-camera-enhancing-apps-all-at-no-cost-for-2024/"><u>[New] Explore the Best iOS Camera Enhancing Apps - All at No Cost for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-boosting-your-channels-free-tips-for-youtube-video-popularity/"><u>[New] In 2024, Boosting Your Channels Free Tips for YouTube Video Popularity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-fade-techniques-in-audio-production-with-adobe-tools/"><u>[New] In 2024, Fade Techniques in Audio Production with Adobe Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ptimal-video-intros-selecting-the-top-16-to-increase-views/"><u>[New] Optimal Video Intros Selecting the Top 16 to Increase Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-perfectly-positioned-cards-youtube-embedding-techniques/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Perfectly Positioned Cards YouTube Embedding Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-save-money-and-time-creating-engaging-youtube-intros-without-paying/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Save Money & Time Creating Engaging YouTube Intros Without Paying</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-silly-screens-top-youtube-humorists-worth-your-time/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Silly Screens Top YouTube Humorists Worth Your Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-ultimate-screen-upgrade-high-resolution-video-enhancer/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Ultimate Screen Upgrade High-Resolution Video Enhancer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-visionary-storytelling-for-video-viewers-growth-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Visionary Storytelling for Video Viewers' Growth for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-voices-vibrate-on-vinyl-perfecting-podcast-scriptwriting/"><u>[Updated] Voices Vibrate on Vinyl Perfecting Podcast Scriptwriting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-chill-vibes-current-hits-to-match-your-yt-short-tunes/"><u>2024 Approved Chill Vibes Current Hits to Match Your YT Short Tunes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-strategic-marketing-websites-for-youtube-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Strategic Marketing Websites for YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/4-feasible-ways-to-fake-location-on-facebook-for-your-apple-iphone-xr-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>4 Feasible Ways to Fake Location on Facebook For your Apple iPhone XR | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-7-energizing-youtube-exercise-challenges-for-viewers-participation/"><u>In 2024, 7 Energizing YouTube Exercise Challenges for Viewers' Participation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/y-letters-on-screen-bounce-with-ease-and-style-for-2024/"><u>Lively Letters on Screen Bounce with Ease and Style for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/master-your-screen-time-top-10-in-depth-guide-to-excellent-offline-ios-gaming/"><u>Master Your Screen Time - Top 10 In-Depth Guide to Excellent Offline iOS Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/samsung-ue590-4k-freesync-gaming-monitor-review-for-2024/"><u>Samsung UE590 4K FreeSync Gaming Monitor Review for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This is achieved using a simple process of clicking “import” from the “file” drop-down menu. Once you have finished importing your photos or video files, you can then drag them from the sidebar and into the editing area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-interface.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h5><ul><li>If the videos you want to import are already published online, you can start the process by first downloading them directly from YouTube first, making sure to save them as MP4 files.</li><li>The best way of importing videos from YouTube is by using an innovative video converter like Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate. This program will help in downloading and converting files to a format that is supported by Adobe Premier.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-2-Editing"><a href="#Step-2-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Editing"></a>Step 2: Editing</h4><p> The next step in how edit YouTube videos with Adobe Premiere is to start modifying the video files or photos the way you want. To achieve this, click on “Effects Control” and apply the desired effects. If you want to insert some text or words into your video, select “title” and then click “new title.” Now choose how you would like the words to behave, for instance, “Default Roll” makes the text roll upwards in the page.</p><p> Now drag the text that you have created into the editor area. If you want to edit the text, simply double-click to select it, and it will bring up a separate page where you can make further edits. You can then modify the text, font, and the positioning as well. This page also allows you to set whether the text will crawl or roll.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-text-with-premiere-pro-3.jpg"                                     ></p><p> The final part of the process is to import your chosen audio file.

You came to the right place; here’s a list of Youtube minimum criteria to reach the threshold.</p><h3 id="1-1K-subscribers"><a href="#1-1K-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="1. 1K subscribers"></a>1. 1K subscribers</h3><p>The first requirement to monetize your channel is to increase your subscribers to at least 1000.</p><h3 id="2-Follow-all-the-YouTube-channel-monetization-policies"><a href="#2-Follow-all-the-YouTube-channel-monetization-policies" class="headerlink" title="2.

AdSense account"></a>6. AdSense account</h3><p>You’ll need to ensure that you have a Google Adsense account set up and ready to go. Without an Adsense account, the video isn’t eligible to be monetized.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Get-Paid-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Get-Paid-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do You Get Paid on YouTube?"></a>Part 2: How Do You Get Paid on YouTube?</h2><p>We know that making money from YouTube can be challenging but not impossible. We’ll help you figure out how to get paid. Whether you want to create your videos and monetize them or you want to take advantage of the huge pool of talent. We’ll show you what the impact of the Youtube Partner program is on the revenue of YouTube channel owners:</p><h3 id="Video-length"><a href="#Video-length" class="headerlink" title="Video length"></a>Video length</h3><p>One of the most noteworthy characteristics of a YouTube video is its length. A longer video provides a greater amount of information, which means a greater likelihood of the viewer actually watching it to completion.</p><h3 id="Ad-Quality"><a href="#Ad-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Ad Quality"></a>Ad Quality</h3><p>The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what’s happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you’re looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.</p><h3 id="Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives"><a href="#Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives" class="headerlink" title="Number of clicks each ad receives"></a>Number of clicks each ad receives</h3><p>The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes. You can increase your ads’ revenue potential by increasing the ad’s number of clicks. Advertisers use this metric to gauge the effectiveness of their campaigns, which is why optimizing the number of clicks your ads get is so important.</p><h3 id="Ad-Blockers"><a href="#Ad-Blockers" class="headerlink" title="Ad Blockers"></a>Ad Blockers</h3><p>And there are two problems with ad blocking. The first is that it cuts off revenue. The second problem is that it reduces user engagement. Ad blocking decreases the amount of time that users spend watching videos. Youtube videos that rely on advertising to generate revenue may decrease their income.</p><h3 id="Bonus-See-how-much-you-can-get-by-YouTube-Pay-Calculator"><a href="#Bonus-See-how-much-you-can-get-by-YouTube-Pay-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: See how much you can get by YouTube Pay Calculator"></a>Bonus: See how much you can get by YouTube Pay Calculator</h3><p>Calculating your potential earnings from YouTube is a great way to see if it is worth your time to start a channel and create videos for certain niches. It can also help you set realistic expectations for the average earnings you can expect.</p><p>A YouTube pay calculator is a simple way to estimate how much money you can make from your YouTube channel.

Some people like to make YouTube tutorials about iPhone or iPad apps, others like to share their gaming experiences, and some need to use footage taken from their devices for presentations. Even if you do not think these kinds of videos suit your vlog, screen recording is a useful tool to have on your belt. You never know when one of your subscribers is going to ask you about your favorite mobile games.</p><p>Basically, there are three ways to record YouTube video on iPhone&#x2F;iPad, including the built-in screen recorder (if you have <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/ios/update" >updated to iOS 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), connecting iPhone to Mac and the last, some third party screen recorder.

Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac"></a>2. Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac</h2><p>If you have a Mac then you already have all the software you need.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Connect your tablet or smartphone to your computer using a USB port, and then open QuickTime on your Mac. In QuickTime select ‘File’ and ‘New Movie Recording’. A recording window will pop up.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the recording window there will be a red ‘record’ button. Next to that button there will be an arrow. Click the arrow and a menu of recording options will appear. In the section where it says ‘Camera’ select your iPhone or iPad. In this menu you can also choose whether or not to record audio from your device, such sound effects from games.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Once you are finished in this menu click record to begin recording the screen of your device. Click ‘stop’ when you are finished recording.</p><p>Although you can download a version of QuickTime for PC, the PC version does not have a screen recording option. If you have a PC you will need to use the second method.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135415/19272" target="_top" id="2135415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135415/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Wirelessly-Using-AirPlay-and-Reflector-For-Mac-or-PC"><a href="#3-Wirelessly-Using-AirPlay-and-Reflector-For-Mac-or-PC" class="headerlink" title="3. Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector(For Mac or PC!)"></a>3. Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector(For Mac or PC!)</h2><p>If you either prefer to do things wirelessly or own a PC then you will need to use a slightly more round-about method. Rather than recording directly from your iPhone you will be mirroring your device’s interface onto your computer screen and then recording it there.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you will need to download a third party mirroring app. Reflector is the popular choice. You can download Reflector at <a class="link"   href="http://www.airsquirrels.com/" >Airsquirrels.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.Next, you need to have Apple’s Airplay on your device. Make sure Reflector that your computer and device are connected to the same wifi network.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Open Reflector on your PC. Initially it will tell you there is no device connected.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Open AirPlay on your device and make sure mirroring is turned on. Your computer’s name will show up as a receiver option. Select it.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This will cause the display of your smartphone or tablet to pop up on your computer screen. Once your device is being mirrored on your computer, record your computer screen.</p><p>You can record your Mac or PC screen using Filmora Video Editor. Using Filmora you can crop out and record only your iPhone display instead of your entire computer screen. You can download the latest version of Filmora Video Editor at Filmora.wondershare.com.</p><p>If you have a Mac you can also record your computer screen in QuickTime following the same steps listed above, until it comes time to choose your camera. Then you record your desktop instead of your device. There are a few different screen recording programs you can download for PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982499">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982499">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982499%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982499/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After reading the three ways to record YouTube on iPhone&#x2F;iPad, I am sure you want to give it a try.
