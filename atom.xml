But with no experience or training, it’s hard to know how to start a vlog and make money.</p><p>Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered!</p><p>This course shows you how to launch a profitable YouTube channel and monetize your new channel. You’ll learn everything you need to know, from finding your niche and the best ways to promote your vlog. Once your vlog starts getting views, you’ll see how to turn your viewers into subscribers, make money, and become a YouTube sensation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-1.jpg"                      alt="start vlog and make money"                ></p><p><strong>Background of vlogs on YouTube</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-2.jpg"                      alt="background of vlogs on youtube"                ></p><p>What started off as a way for vloggers to share their thoughts about topics they were passionate about eventually turned into a full-blown industry. According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.</p><p><strong>Why vlogs are loved by people</strong></p><p>Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.</p><p>But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">YouTube Ads</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Brand Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Affiliate Marketing</a></li><li><a href="#part3-4">Patreon</a></li><li><a href="#part3-5">Sell your service or products</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?</h2><p>So you’ve started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren’t you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let’s look at some common reasons why vloggers aren’t making any income and figure out how to get around them.</p><h3 id="Who-is-my-target-audience"><a href="#Who-is-my-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Who is my target audience?"></a>Who is my target audience?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg"                      alt="target audience"                ></p><p>So, let’s be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren’t making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.</p><h3 id="What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience"><a href="#What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="What solutions am I offering?

Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?</h3><p>The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you’re addressing the target audience’s needs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel</h2><p>It’s easy to get started on YouTube. Go to the website, set up a free account, and upload videos. But when it comes to growing a profitable vlog YouTube channel, there are some tricks to getting the best results. Here are the three things you must do to achieve the success that will bring you money.</p><h3 id="Find-your-niche-what-is-a-niche-and-how-to-find"><a href="#Find-your-niche-what-is-a-niche-and-how-to-find" class="headerlink" title="Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)"></a>Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)</h3><p>A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you’re passionate about and what you’re good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you’re offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.</p><h3 id="Consistency-and-patience"><a href="#Consistency-and-patience" class="headerlink" title="Consistency and patience"></a>Consistency and patience</h3><p>Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people’s interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><h3 id="Content-quality"><a href="#Content-quality" class="headerlink" title="Content quality"></a>Content quality</h3><p>With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it’s clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative. YouTube’s algorithm favors videos with large numbers of views, so if you’re looking to start a profitable vlog YouTube channel, you’ll need to add quality, creativity, and useful content for viewers.</p><p>And to do that, you must try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video editing software.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Ads"><a href="#YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.</p><h3 id="Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Marketing"></a>Affiliate Marketing</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg"                      alt="youtube affiliate marketing"                ></p><p>Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it’s through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.</p><h3 id="Patreon"><a href="#Patreon" class="headerlink" title="Patreon"></a>Patreon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg"                      alt="support on patreon"                ></p><p>Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike. By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSFNIAYChbA?si=4TIlsUrYmY5vP2il" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Sell-your-service-or-products"><a href="#Sell-your-service-or-products" class="headerlink" title="Sell your service or products"></a>Sell your service or products</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg"                      alt="sell products or services"                ></p><p>With over 1 billion monthly active users, there’s an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services. You could sell your physical products to your audience as a vlogger. The best method this can be done is by creating an online store that sells T-shirts and mugs with your branding. Make sure those products must be related to your niche or channel category. As for services, you could also offer tips on improving your life, starting an online business, or even becoming a successful Youtuber!</p><h2 id="Part-4-Top-10-Highest-Paid-Vloggers-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-4-Top-10-Highest-Paid-Vloggers-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube"></a>Part 4: Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</h2><p>Vloggers on YouTube are earning some big money.

Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship-1"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship-1" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations"><a href="#Technical-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epKTCSREjhI?si=Ez_hObK1FZrmEE7f" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations-1"><a href="#Technical-Considerations-1" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility-1"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback-1"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync-1"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HtM7d4dpN1I?si=2vN_xgVGD4eYGORu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download.

You are able to interact with your viewers by using the comments and people are able to follow you so that they are notified of new videos and comments. As there is already a huge following on YouTube it’s easy to get a good following if you have great content. It’s harder to control public content which is a downside to using YouTube and there is very little customer support. With the comments being moderated rarely it can cause a distraction from your video. Businesses tend to internally block YouTube video’s which means you won’t get the viewings from people on their lunch breaks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-vs-youtube-communities.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-vs-youtube-communities"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hsPbiic0O8?si=58mZ2Cu6wicQfsUP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> With higher quality content and no advertisements video owners can quickly build a valid following and gain comments from people that are contributing high value information. You have more detailed analytics which makes it easier to see where you are going wrong should you not have the following you want and you are able to use your own domain. With Google owning YouTube you are unlikely to get the same exposure you would, however the followers tend to be valid giving you a real idea of where you are going right or wrong. Because of the higher quality followers you are less likely to get negative or abusive comments when you use Vimeo, however it is a paid subscription with each tier giving you more space to upload.</p><h4 id="2-Membership"><a href="#2-Membership" class="headerlink" title="2  Membership"></a>2  Membership</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> YouTube on the other hand is free for all to use because the main focus is getting their equity through advertisements. There is however the option to take out a subscription which is known as YouTube Red. This lets you watch as many video’s as you want without having to view the ads and also gets you the ability to download so you don’t have to go online to view your favourite videos, a music app and original programming facilities.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> There are 4 different membership options with Vimeo allowing you to tailor it to your needs; there is the basic, plus, pro and business. The higher the cost, the greater level of support and storage capacity you will get. There is a free membership available but you will only be able to use up to 500MB each week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-membership.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-membership"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhLjZsruC9M?si=-861oUSfrUde2Ykt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Advertising"><a href="#3-Advertising" class="headerlink" title="3  Advertising"></a>3  Advertising</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> What makes YouTube free is the fact they get their money from the advertisements they put not only on their sites but before video’s that people have to watch a set amount of seconds for before they can view their video of choice. This is great news if you are a marketer as it will allow you to reach out to viewers on video’s that are relevant to your brand&#x2F;product&#x2F;service, however for those that are viewing the sheer amount of ads can be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-advertising.jpg"                      alt="youtube-advertising"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAnyQ0uj9Yg?si=Es4_ulcdM_-LuDcq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> As a paid subscription service and even the limited free package, you won’t have to view or show viewers ads, which means that your videos are more likely to be seen in their entirety not abandoned due to advertisements.</p><h4 id="4-Updating-video"><a href="#4-Updating-video" class="headerlink" title="4  Updating video"></a>4  Updating video</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> If you upload videos to YouTube you do not have the same benefits as the only way to amend a video is to take it down, delete it and re-upload a new one. This unfortunately takes with it any statistics such as views that you have gained. If you do choose YouTube for your videos then do make sure you check everything vigorously before you upload it as there’s no way to change it.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> Occasionally an uploaded video may need some changes made. This could be due to changes to the offer you have or you have noticed something else that needs amending. With Vimeo if you need to update a video you can do so without losing the statistics it has already gained, which is great news if you notice an error later down the line or need to add or take something away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-uploading.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-uploading"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>When it comes down to making the final decision between using YouTube or Vimeo you will need to look at the type of audience you want to attract. With Vimeo you are more likely to attract creators and film makers, whereas with YouTube you will have a bigger audience to target which gives you a better chance of a higher rank on search engines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aIx71tPaWKg?si=lG5OiUe-M6eBJf5b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;

Teachers can now collaborate, connect and innovate with a multitude of students in ways that were never imagined before by employing the power of YouTube.</p><p><strong>Enhances the comprehension of complex topics</strong></p><p> Certain subjects are technical in nature and teachers usually have a hard time explaining them to the students. By using YouTube in the classroom, teachers are an a better position to offer clear and easy to understand illustrations which will in turn demystify the tough concepts and make it easy for students to understand and comprehend complex topics.</p><p><strong>Creates more engagement from students</strong></p><p> Learning primarily comprises of audio and visual components. Unlike traditional modes of teaching where the teacher offered explanation and the students are expected to take notes, videos are more engaging and has the power to make students stay more alert, thus increase their chances of absorbing the lesions and getting most from the subjects.</p><p><strong>Ideal for slow learners</strong></p><p> When using YouTube in the classroom, the teacher has full control on the pace of learning and this is ideal for taking of both the fast and slow learners. In case a student finds a concept being explained too fast, they can simply request the part to be replayed or it can be slowed down to play at a pace that will be easy for them to grasp.</p><p><strong>One teacher, multiple classrooms</strong></p><p> The other benefit of using YouTube in the classroom is that after a teacher prepares his learning videos, they get the flexibility using the video in more than just one classroom. It also makes it easy for them when they are away and they need to attend classes. All they have to do is to use the prerecorded video lesions so that they don’t entirely miss out on classes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E3yY7lZ-FKA?si=g8VEuExP8GH59B69" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-in-Classroom"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-in-Classroom" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube in Classroom"></a>Tips for Using YouTube in Classroom</h2><p> For teachers and tutors, there are various ways of using YouTube in the classroom. These methods offer the flexibility to both the teachers and the students to give and understand lessons respectively. Here are some of the ways for teachers to use YouTube in classrooms-:</p><ol><li><strong>Trigger unique and interesting discussions</strong>– teachers using YouTube in the classrooms can trigger interesting and unique discussions amongst their students. The teachers can use relevant videos on news reports, documentaries, current affairs and much more to get the student opinions and gauge the impact of the learning on the students.</li><li><strong>Access high quality education materials for free</strong> – using YouTube in classroom also makes it possible to teachers to access high quality learning materials for free. This is especially important when teaching on tough subjects or when reviewing for exams.</li><li><strong>Short clips to put a topic in context</strong> – there are documentary channels such as National Geographic, BBC and Channel 4 amongst others where teachers can obtain and play short clips to put the subject matter into proper context for the students.</li><li><strong>Archive your work</strong>– use videos to keep a clean and neat record of the various lessons thus making it easy for current and future students to access them with ease.</li><li><strong>Review for exams</strong> – when exams are just about the corner, videos become very effective in helping the student to refresh their minds on tough topics that might require a lot of time to review during exams.</li><li><strong>Flip lessons</strong>– flipped learning is taking strong roots in most of the learning institutions and it becomes easy and efficient when using videos in the classroom.</li><li><strong>Teach when you are absent</strong> – instead of missing class or having a guest teacher to stand in for you, you can simply record the lesson on your YouTube channel or simply give out instructions for the students to follow when you are away.</li><li><strong>Allow students to gain in-depth information</strong>– by using YouTube in classroom, teachers are essentially allowing their students to dig deeper and comprehend the lessons better.</li><li><strong>Help the struggling students</strong> – videos are great for the slow learners since they can rewind or play it at their own pace.</li><li><strong>Create a YouTube Channel</strong> – this is to contain all the videos relevant to a particular subject or lesion for current and future students.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=heERQcpMi77lqToE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-discover-the-best-educational-videos-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-discover-the-best-educational-videos-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to discover the best educational videos on YouTube"></a>How to discover the best educational videos on YouTube</h2><p> YouTube is awash with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >millions of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it is imperative that you know how to search for and discover the best education videos.

Teachers can now access millions of students around the globe by using YT videos and students can also get a lot of detailed information, some on technical topics that would normally take a long time to comprehend.

You get entertained and also have a chance to share your videos with the world. Among the popular apps are TikTok and Shorts. TikTok got to the market earlier but has so far found a new competitor in the field. Shorts video has now fully emerged from YouTube and has almost the same playing ground. But it is still unclear whether <strong>YouTube Shorts and TikTok</strong> are comparable. While TikTok has over 2 billion downloads, YouTube, on the other hand, already has a massive audience for the tough tussle.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts give both creators and viewers the chance to share short videos for entertainment and promotional purposes. However, they are different in various aspects. Both the apps have their disadvantages and advantages, depending on a user’s preference.

TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version.

And, in this digitally oriented world, you’re left with no reason not to create a YouTube channel specifically when you have the right talent to use one. Well, this guide is for those who are already into YouTube video creation and now need help on how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong> as per different aspect ratios. According to YouTube’s aspect ratio, it’s the right place to move forward even if you want to resize your videos present on other social media apps. We know brands and other influencers generally practice this kind of social media marketing.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our session on resizing YouTube as per the ideal aspect ratio without further ado.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?</h2><p>For attracting more audience and increasing engagement on YouTube videos, you have to look at each factor, along with the YouTube video quality. And, you cannot overlook the size of YouTube video among these factors to make it your perfect shot among competitors. Considering the importance of such factors, we’ve come up with this specific section on introducing you to the correct aspect ratio for YouTube videos.</p><p>It’s crucial to know the size before you start the YouTube game!</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload videos of different sizes ranging from 240p to 8K. And, the dimensions for these different sizes are as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>240p:</strong> 426x240 pixels</li><li><strong>360p:</strong> 640x360 pixels</li><li><strong>480p:</strong> 854x480 pixels</li><li><strong>720p:</strong> 1280x720 pixels</li><li><strong>1080p:</strong> 1920x1080 pixels</li><li><strong>1440p:</strong> 2560x1440 pixels</li><li><strong>2160p:</strong> 3840x2160 pixels</li><li><strong>43200p:</strong> 7680×4320 pixels</li></ul><p>Along with these, the aspect ratio, video size, and length of YouTube video should also be taken into consideration while uploading YouTube videos.</p><p>Thus, the ideal aspect ratio to <strong>resize YouTube video</strong> is perfect as 16:9, which we’ll diversify in the following three sections.</p><p><strong>1. Computer</strong></p><p>On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.</p><p><strong>2. Android Phone</strong></p><p>In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size. The video will always fit the screen, whether it’s square, vertical, or horizontal. Ultimately, the videos will be shorter for widescreen and square for vertical.</p><p><strong>3. iPad &amp; iPhone</strong></p><p>Similarly, the YouTube app for iPad and iPhone automatically adjust the video size to fit the screen. Thus, every video will fit the screen, even if it’s square, horizontal, or vertical.</p><p>Before we let you know how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong>, here are some tips for creating awesome YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>Create a strategy for YouTube video beforehand.</li><li>Search for ideas and topics.</li><li>Understand the use of the best equipment and gear.</li><li>Ensure the best YouTube video editing.</li><li>Optimize YouTube videos.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac"></a>Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac</h2><p>Hopefully, you have noted the correct aspect ratio required for YouTube videos.

Right from the beginning, we’ve discussed the importance of creating YouTube videos in this digital transformation age and further considering the right fit of factors, including the size, length, quality, and aspect ratio of specific YouTube videos. Even though YouTube has the facility to adjust the video automatically, you have to edit in the cropped video, which is possible through integrated editing programs such as the one we’ve discussed above via Wondershare Filmora for Mac.

People feel relaxed and ready to catch up on social media’s trending in the evening. So, posting in the evenings on weekdays may instantly help you get some increased views.</p><h4 id="Target-Thursdays-and-Fridays"><a href="#Target-Thursdays-and-Fridays" class="headerlink" title="- Target Thursdays and Fridays"></a>- Target Thursdays and Fridays</h4><p>Depending on your YouTube content, you can target school-age children these days. If your content is about kid’s stuff and other online learning skills, then pushing it just before the weekend could give you some good visits. Kids tend to have various activities over the weekend and so, the best time for them to embark on online learning is just before the weekend kicks off.</p><h4 id="Weekends"><a href="#Weekends" class="headerlink" title="- Weekends"></a>- Weekends</h4><p>Weekends will suit content that needs to sell products to the middle-class. Since they are busy the whole week with other duties, they probably find time over the weekend to chill and check out what’s happening around them and the world at large.</p><h4 id="End-year"><a href="#End-year" class="headerlink" title="- End year"></a>- End year</h4><p>When it comes to the best months to post on YouTube, the end-year period tends to be the best. Usually, this is when companies and individuals are winding up on their busy schedules of the year. They want to get improvements and tips to start the next year. It is wise to spend more time online, giving the necessary tips and probably hooking up some potential customers.</p><h2 id="Best-Days-to-Post-on-YouTube-Individual-channel"><a href="#Best-Days-to-Post-on-YouTube-Individual-channel" class="headerlink" title="Best Days to Post on YouTube - Individual channel"></a>Best Days to Post on YouTube - Individual channel</h2><p>Stop guessing and find the facts right. Hitting on the road at the right time can get you as many viewers as possible. YouTube makes getting the facts right quite easy. Just use YouTube studio to know when your viewers are online.</p><p>First, go to YouTube Studio<br>Check in the “YouTube Studio” &gt; “Analytics” &gt; “Audience” option. Remember that your channel should have enough views for this option to give you relevant data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-2.png"                      alt="best days to post on youtube - check performance"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cC-HtDQVoG0?si=nQcoa7q8q2IL8U0m" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Find the hours with the darkest purple bars<br>You’ll realize that there are dark bars and light ones. The latter represent when few viewers are on your channel. Avoid posting during such times and focus when you have many viewers on site. Also, try to post a few hours before the peak time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-3.png"                      alt="best days to post on youtube - find the darkest bar"                ></p><p>Focus on the days with the darkest bars<br>Apart from specific times of the day, you can focus on days of the week when your viewers are on your channel. You will mostly realize that the best days of the week to post to your channel are on weekends. It is quite typical as it’s the days when viewers are more relaxed and can find new things online. However, you can monitor your statistics and learn the number of days per week you need to emphasize more on posting your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-4.png"                      alt="choose the best days to post on youtube"                ></p><p>Post videos a day before the peak day<br>You can also dwell on the narrative; the early bird catches the worm. You can make an early catch since you know the day when your viewers will throng’ your channel, but you don’t know the time. Post videos a day before your channel goes busy. By this, you won’t leave any viewers outside your new postings.</p><p>A few hours before prime time<br>Another trick is to get your videos posted in good time. Once you have known the best hour of the day when viewers are likely to be active, make your video available a few hours before then. They’ll then get it rolling once they land into the channel for the newest updates. If not, you may miss out on views you would have gotten by making your video go public earlier.</p><p>Upload your videos in private a few hours before publishing<br>Yes, mistakes do happen, and you don’t want to be caught up in the mix of errors. You can increase perfection by uploading your videos for some hours before publishing them. It will give you a good time to check it out privately and iron out any concerns. You don’t want your video going viral with tons of mishaps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITtcSWvS8bo?si=4M4BfMgaabrW6148" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Create-High-Quality-Video-with-Filmora-to-Ensure-Video-Engagement"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-Video-with-Filmora-to-Ensure-Video-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality Video with Filmora to Ensure Video Engagement"></a>Create High-Quality Video with Filmora to Ensure Video Engagement</h2><p>Besides knowing the best days to post on YouTube, you have to give your audience quality for their time.

You can use YouTube algorithm Studio to calculate and give you the exact hours and days when your viewers are at bay. But again, this will only be effective if you have already gathered a substantial number of viewers. It will, therefore, not work for you if you are starting on YouTube. Usually, there isn’t enough data yet for the system to know the best time to publish, and neither know how your content performs in general.</p><p>● But all in all, you can use general practices to know when to post your content. Most likely, combine your efforts and don’t dwell on specific hours or days. Use both combined to reach as many audiences as possible.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Creators have one thing in mind when posting their content online.

Since they are busy the whole week with other duties, they probably find time over the weekend to chill and check out what’s happening around them and the world at large.</p><h4 id="End-year-3"><a href="#End-year-3" class="headerlink" title="- End year"></a>- End year</h4><p>When it comes to the best months to post on YouTube, the end-year period tends to be the best. Usually, this is when companies and individuals are winding up on their busy schedules of the year. They want to get improvements and tips to start the next year. It is wise to spend more time online, giving the necessary tips and probably hooking up some potential customers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOVkXoUxLf4?si=QfC18T2cb5OkiaXo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Days-to-Post-on-YouTube-Individual-channel-3"><a href="#Best-Days-to-Post-on-YouTube-Individual-channel-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Days to Post on YouTube - Individual channel"></a>Best Days to Post on YouTube - Individual channel</h2><p>Stop guessing and find the facts right. Hitting on the road at the right time can get you as many viewers as possible. YouTube makes getting the facts right quite easy. Just use YouTube studio to know when your viewers are online.</p><p>First, go to YouTube Studio<br>Check in the “YouTube Studio” &gt; “Analytics” &gt; “Audience” option. Remember that your channel should have enough views for this option to give you relevant data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-2.png"                      alt="best days to post on youtube - check performance"                ></p><p>Find the hours with the darkest purple bars<br>You’ll realize that there are dark bars and light ones. The latter represent when few viewers are on your channel. Avoid posting during such times and focus when you have many viewers on site. Also, try to post a few hours before the peak time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-3.png"                      alt="best days to post on youtube - find the darkest bar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LI9nKlbhnw8?si=uUXFVbuEqXtFHHv0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Focus on the days with the darkest bars<br>Apart from specific times of the day, you can focus on days of the week when your viewers are on your channel. You will mostly realize that the best days of the week to post to your channel are on weekends. It is quite typical as it’s the days when viewers are more relaxed and can find new things online. However, you can monitor your statistics and learn the number of days per week you need to emphasize more on posting your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-4.png"                      alt="choose the best days to post on youtube"                ></p><p>Post videos a day before the peak day<br>You can also dwell on the narrative; the early bird catches the worm. You can make an early catch since you know the day when your viewers will throng’ your channel, but you don’t know the time. Post videos a day before your channel goes busy. By this, you won’t leave any viewers outside your new postings.</p><p>A few hours before prime time<br>Another trick is to get your videos posted in good time. Once you have known the best hour of the day when viewers are likely to be active, make your video available a few hours before then. They’ll then get it rolling once they land into the channel for the newest updates. If not, you may miss out on views you would have gotten by making your video go public earlier.</p><p>Upload your videos in private a few hours before publishing<br>Yes, mistakes do happen, and you don’t want to be caught up in the mix of errors. You can increase perfection by uploading your videos for some hours before publishing them. It will give you a good time to check it out privately and iron out any concerns. You don’t want your video going viral with tons of mishaps.</p><h2 id="Create-High-Quality-Video-with-Filmora-to-Ensure-Video-Engagement-3"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-Video-with-Filmora-to-Ensure-Video-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality Video with Filmora to Ensure Video Engagement"></a>Create High-Quality Video with Filmora to Ensure Video Engagement</h2><p>Besides knowing the best days to post on YouTube, you have to give your audience quality for their time.

You can use YouTube algorithm Studio to calculate and give you the exact hours and days when your viewers are at bay. But again, this will only be effective if you have already gathered a substantial number of viewers. It will, therefore, not work for you if you are starting on YouTube. Usually, there isn’t enough data yet for the system to know the best time to publish, and neither know how your content performs in general.</p><p>● But all in all, you can use general practices to know when to post your content. Most likely, combine your efforts and don’t dwell on specific hours or days. Use both combined to reach as many audiences as possible.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-crafting-videos-with-precision-leveraging-storyremix-in-windows-11/"><u>[New] Crafting Videos with Precision Leveraging StoryRemix in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-rapid-techniques-mix-up-and-shuffle-youtube-listings/"><u>[New] In 2024, Rapid Techniques Mix Up and Shuffle YouTube Listings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/nleashing-video-popularity-leading-trackers-for-youtube/"><u>[New] Unleashing Video Popularity Leading Trackers for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-youtube-mastery-made-simple-the-top-20-must-know-strategies/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved YouTube Mastery Made Simple The Top 20 Must-Know Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-from-editing-desk-to-youtube-post-production-processes/"><u>[Updated] From Editing Desk to YouTube Post-Production Processes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-introduction-to-effective-telegram-promotion-for-rookies/"><u>[Updated] Introduction to Effective Telegram Promotion for Rookies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/cing-winter-vlogs-with-five-heartwarming-backdrops/"><u>Enhancing Winter Vlogs with Five Heartwarming Backdrops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/forgot-pattern-lock-heres-how-you-can-unlock-samsung-galaxy-a24-pattern-lock-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>Forgot Pattern Lock?

YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.</p><p>For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title"><a href="#2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="2.

You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.</p><p>Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail.

You can quickly scroll via algorithmically-driven feed, discover other similar short videos, and subscribe to your favorite creators.</p><p>Here, creators can record, share, and edit short-form video content that’s 60 seconds or less and vertically oriented. And, unlike Instagram stories, YouTube Shorts won’t disappear but will remain on your channel. So, that’s the brief intro of YouTube Shorts which we think everyone is aware of after YouTube has announced its YouTube Shorts availability globally.</p><p>However, certain factors are still there, raising the issue or concern of <strong>YouTube Shorts not showing</strong>. Thus, if you can’t find the YouTube Shorts option or videos, or YouTube Shorts disappeared, find a solution in this post.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LI9nKlbhnw8?si=uUXFVbuEqXtFHHv0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Do-YouTube-Shorts-Not-Showing-Up"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Do-YouTube-Shorts-Not-Showing-Up" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Do YouTube Shorts Not Showing Up?"></a>Part 1: Why Do YouTube Shorts Not Showing Up?</h2><p>There could be multiple reasons why YouTube Shorts not showing on your phone, the channel’s home page etc.</p><p>Besides, many scenarios arise with this issue, namely the YouTube Shorts option not showing up, the YouTube Shorts button missing, and YouTube Shorts videos not showing correctly.</p><p>And, there are valid reasons as well as to why these situations are happening to you. So, let’s discuss each of them separately in brief, along with the solutions in the next section.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Shorts are not showing on the channel’s homepage</strong></li></ul><p>The standard and the most common reason why YouTube Shorts are not showing on the channel’s homepage is that you have not updated the YouTube app.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Shorts option not showing up</strong></li></ul><p>This may be happening either because you’ve not updated the app or your internet connection is pretty slow to show you the option. There could be another reason as you may not have cleared the YouTube mobile app’s cache and data.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Shorts button missing</strong></li></ul><p>Again, you may not have updated the YouTube app, or your internet connection is slow is the most common reason here. Moreover, the button of YouTube Shorts stays hidden behind the +icon.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Shorts videos not showing correctly</strong></li></ul><p>The most valid reason for YouTube Shorts not showing correctly or YouTube Shorts disappearing is that you have a poor internet connection. Plus, we’ve discussed proper steps below if you’ve missed something while uploading the YouTube Shorts triggering this scenario.</p><p>Before we move on to fixing YouTube Shorts not showing the issue, here’s a quick note on which videos qualify as YouTube Shorts. Shorts are different from YouTube stories. Unlike YouTube stories, it gets displayed in your regular channel feed along with your other YouTube videos.</p><p>And, you must note that a YouTube Shorts video consists of two criteria as follows.</p><ul><li>The video has to be vertical (portrait-style)</li><li>The video must be 60 seconds or less</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Not-Showing-Up"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Not-Showing-Up" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Shorts Not Showing Up?"></a>Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Shorts Not Showing Up?</h2><p>Here’s the section covering fixes on YouTube Shorts not showing.

The newest version of the YouTube mobile app (Version: 16.17.36) has a dedicated Shorts button at the bottom. And, it replaces the Trending button from the YouTube app.</p><p>Moreover, the option to upload Shorts is now hidden behind the <strong>+</strong> icon. Tap on the <strong>+</strong> icon and hit the <strong>Create a Short</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-not-showing-1.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Check-If-Shorts-Is-Available-in-Your-Country"><a href="#Fix-2-Check-If-Shorts-Is-Available-in-Your-Country" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Check If Shorts Is Available in Your Country"></a>Fix 2: Check If Shorts Is Available in Your Country</h3><p>Now, YouTube Shorts is available globally, but there was a phase when YouTube Shorts was a beta feature. It was only available in India and the US, which could be why you could not view Shorts in the YouTube app.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-YouTube-Shorts-Is-Mobile-only"><a href="#Fix-3-YouTube-Shorts-Is-Mobile-only" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: YouTube Shorts Is Mobile-only"></a>Fix 3: YouTube Shorts Is Mobile-only</h3><p>As of now, YouTube Shorts is only available on a smartphone because it’s still in beta version. However, you can create Shorts via smartphone and the camera option in YouTube mobile app. Hence, there’s no point in searching for Shorts on your computer.</p><p>You can upload Shorts videos from your laptop. The entire process is similar to uploading a regular video. However, you have to mention #Shorts in the title and description to differentiate it as a Shorts video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmXpl6irBYk?si=BXjGpQr6PXFcqhCI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Common-Fixes-to-YouTube-Shorts-Not-Working"><a href="#Common-Fixes-to-YouTube-Shorts-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Common Fixes to YouTube Shorts Not Working"></a>Common Fixes to YouTube Shorts Not Working</h3><ol><li>Update the YouTube App to the latest version.</li><li>Clear the YouTube mobile app’s data and cache.</li><li>Check if your internet is connected or your internet connection is strong.</li><li>Restart your smartphone and try again.</li><li>The YouTube server can be down, busy, or under maintenance. Wait for a while and try again.</li></ol><p>The fixes above are also applicable if the YouTube Shorts are not showing on iPhone as well.</p><p>Or, you can try the VPN solution before contacting the YouTube team.</p><h3 id="If-Videos-Are-Not-Visible-under-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#If-Videos-Are-Not-Visible-under-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="If Videos Are Not Visible under YouTube Shorts"></a>If Videos Are Not Visible under YouTube Shorts</h3><p><strong>Solution 1:</strong> Ensure that you’ve added #shorts in the title and description. Those who have YouTube Shorts, they can make shorts videos via the Shorts camera. Those who can’t access this camera can also upload their current vertical videos that are less than 60 seconds after adding the hashtag #Shorts in the title or description.</p><p>All in all, you must include #shorts to let the YouTube algorithm figure out the video is created for Shorts, and the issue of YouTube Shorts not showing up will also be resolved.</p><p><strong>Solution 2:</strong> Sometimes, you may not find YouTube Shorts videos if they’re precisely 60 seconds in duration because YouTube sometimes adds 1-2 seconds to a Shorts video for some reason. So, be alert here and ensure your Shorts video is around 58 seconds or less.</p><p><strong>Solution 3:</strong> If your YouTube Shorts is not getting views, you need to wait more here because it takes a while for YouTube to index a Shorts video and suggest them to people. So, it’s the task of the algorithm that varies from person to person. Some Shorts videos take several days while others take weeks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhLjZsruC9M?si=-861oUSfrUde2Ykt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="If-YouTube-Shorts-Videos-Are-Not-Showing-up-Correctly"><a href="#If-YouTube-Shorts-Videos-Are-Not-Showing-up-Correctly" class="headerlink" title="If YouTube Shorts Videos Are Not Showing up Correctly"></a>If YouTube Shorts Videos Are Not Showing up Correctly</h3><p>Once uploaded, the YouTube Shorts will be displayed in a vertical thumbnail on YouTube and other regular content already there in your account. Or, it’s your choice to create a new channel for the YouTube shorts videos. If the YouTube shorts not showing correctly, you can try as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your channel and select the “customize channel” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Hop on to the <strong>Featured</strong> section, and choose the <strong>add section</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You’ll see shorts videos under the “videos” section. Click that, and the videos you have which are tagged in with #shorts in the title or description will automatically display here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-not-showing-2.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h3 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Easily-Create-Vertical-Videos-for-YouTube-Shorts-on-PC"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Easily-Create-Vertical-Videos-for-YouTube-Shorts-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: How to Easily Create Vertical Videos for YouTube Shorts on PC"></a>Bonus Tip: How to Easily Create Vertical Videos for YouTube Shorts on PC</h3><p>The YouTube Shorts app is pretty convenient to use nowadays. However, it doesn’t allow you to fine-edit the videos if you’ve explored the app or specifically when you want your videos to look more professional. The app doesn’t even have many filtering options, such as Effects, Elements, etc., to make your videos more interactive.</p><p>With that said, you can always use an efficient third-party program like <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a> to create professional-looking YouTube Shorts videos to engage your viewers highly. Even no famous YouTuber uploads their videos directly from the app without using any third-party tool.</p><p>We recommend Wondershare Filmora because it is a production and post-production app available for Windows and Mac computers. It gives tough competition to some globally renowned tools like Final Cut Pro X, Adobe Premiere Pro, etc., because of its simplicity. Furthermore, Filmora has its inbuilt screen, voice recording features, and webcam that can be useful to create game walkthroughs, interactive videos, and voiceovers as needed.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rxyki8-Y630?si=dHLkIxG59zdlZeN0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Moreover, a YouTube Shorts video can be made through Wondershare Filmora using the below-mentioned guide.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We are assuming that you have already recorded a vertical video using your smartphone and that it has been transferred to your PC.</p><p>So, the signature feature to create YouTube Shorts videos on Wondershare Filmora is <strong>Auto Reframe</strong>.</p><p>Powered by AI technology, Auto Reframe automatically identifies the focal point of your video and crops it while always maintaining it within the frame.

In Filmora, you drag that alien effect into your PIP track and switch the green background to transparent.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Your alien buddy will be overlaid over your main clip, which will make it look like he is there with you.

Just go to the watch page for the video and type ‘ss’ in front of YouTube in the address bar (so your address looks like <strong><a class="link"   href="http://www.ssyoutube/" >http://www.ssyoutube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>). You will be taken to a page where you can download the video for free, so long as you don’t want it in HD. You have to pay for the service if you want a higher quality clip, but most of these green screen effects will look fine in 720p.</p><p>Have you made anything cool recently using a green screen?

This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>. During filming, the chosen background color (green or blue) won’t appear in the final result due to its transparency. The subject is captured as if separately from the isolated background.</p><ul><li>Post-Processing:</li></ul><p>In post-production processing, the editor takes the keyed-out color and replaces it with the new background of their choice. This step creates the illusion that the subject is in a different setting or environment. The transparent areas become filled with the chosen background which, if done right, results in a cohesive and visually appealing composition.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fo4lNZ84x9Q?si=WdcYPZp-9VJnZEnC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Green"><a href="#Why-Green" class="headerlink" title="Why Green?"></a>Why Green?</h2><p>Theoretically, the <strong>chroma key background</strong> can be any solid color. However, the most commonly used colors are studio blue and bright green, with the latter far more common.</p><p>The choice of background color depends on the specific requirements of the production and the colors present in the scenes being filmed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Contrast</p><p>The less similar your chosen background color is to natural skin tones, the easier to isolate and replace in your footage. Bright green provides a strong contrast to most human skin tones and is less likely to be present in costumes or natural surroundings, making it easier to isolate subjects during the color separation.</p><p>Luminance</p><p> The color green emits light with greater intensity than blue, allowing for far more effective isolation by cameras during filming. This also means that blue screens demand increased lighting for proper exposure compared to green. This situation may be less than ideal if you lack powerful lighting or you don’t have the big bucks for them.</p><p>Digital Sensors</p><p> Many digital cameras and sensors are more sensitive to green wavelengths, resulting in cleaner and more accurate color keying during post-processing. Modern technology has also evolved to optimize for a green background, making it a more practical choice for the chroma key effect.</p><p>Wardrobe and Set Design</p><p>Bright green occurs less naturally in costumes and set designs than other colors, making green the optimal choice for reducing the likelihood of color spill and keying issues. However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out. This choice determines your effective color separation and ensures a smooth keying process during editing. Choosing a chroma-key background color that contrasts distinctly with the subject’s colors is essential for effective color separation. This prevents unintentional transparency, color spill, and ensures a polished final result.</p><p>Lighting Considerations</p><p>Lighting is an important part of the chroma-keying process. Bold, uniform, and consistent lighting on both the subject and the background makes it easy to delineate one from the other fully. This minimizes shadows and variations in color, creating a smooth and seamless keying process. Multiple diffuse lights from different angles are often used to illuminate the green screen evenly.</p><p>Positioning&#x2F;Camera</p><p>Proper subject and camera placement are necessary to ensure an even color-keying process during post-production. To prevent shadow interference, the green screen should be smooth, tense, and without wrinkles or shadows.</p><p>High-quality cameras are essential every time, especially for chroma keying. Images with better definition are easier to key, so camera quality significantly affects the outcome. Even if your camera isn’t the best, merely shooting well can ensure a clean color-keying process during editing, resulting in professional-looking visuals.</p><h2 id="Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key"><a href="#Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key" class="headerlink" title="Recording Tips for Chroma Key"></a>Recording Tips for Chroma Key</h2><ul><li>Proper Lighting</li></ul><p>Maintaining uniform and well-defined lighting during recording is essential for a successful chroma-keying process. This consistency ensures a seamless keying process during post-production.</p><ul><li>Keep Distance from the Green Screen</li></ul><p>The optimal distance between the subject and the green screen minimizes color spill and allows for natural movements. Proper distance between subject and background allows for easier isolation of the background and much smoother post-editing. A recommended starting point for the issue is around 6 to 10 feet from the background.</p><ul><li>Subjects and Clothing</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, the choice of costume for Selecting appropriate clothing that doesn’t match the chroma key color prevents transparency issues. Subjects also have to be positioned in such a way that there is minimal light interference and reflection. These contribute to a flawless chroma key outcome.</p><h2 id="3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies"><a href="#3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies"></a>3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies</h2><ul><li>Color Spill</li></ul><p>Sometimes, reflected light from your green background can be cast on your subject and may remain so when the background light is keyed out. This phenomenon is known as a color spill. It is usually because of uneven lighting or shooting around reflecting surfaces. Avoiding spill can differentiate between good and lousy chroma key aftereffects.</p><p>Human hair is one area where color spill can show up unsuspectingly. Due to the translucency of hair, it is common for some unintended light to seep through. This allows some background visibility, which you do not want with a chroma key. This is especially notable with lighter hair colors like blond hair.</p><p>There are ways to account for this. Many video-editing software have features such as spill suppression and screen matte adjustments that can enhance the final footage. Specialized plugins also go a long way in ensuring minimizing spill. Addressing spill correction tackles unwanted green artifacts and ensures a clean keying process.</p><ul><li>Poor Lighting</li></ul><p>Suboptimal green screen lighting can lead to inconsistencies in keying and editing, undermining your product. One way to avoid this is to light the screen and subject separately. Another tip, although expensive, is using multiple diffuse light sources and trying to maintain even lighting across every square foot of your scene. Super bright or dark spots can ruin your output, so it’s worth the extra effort if you don’t want to deal with problematic post-production.</p><ul><li>Poorly Refined Edges</li></ul><p>Chroma keying should leave your videos with crisp, defined, natural-looking edges. But post-production editing can make all the difference if it doesn’t come out to your taste. Softening and refining edges make a smoother transition between the foreground object and the new background. Light adjustments to edge thickness and screen matte settings can also help enhance overall visual quality and add finesse to your work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GyfJUhsz_AY?si=x2HjoLX1B89oEPgZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Green screen photography produces excellent results, and its ease of use makes it indispensable for videographers of all levels.

However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMEJvwMM0vk?si=EQF_jo_4u9v5iJ_C" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio-1"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out. This choice determines your effective color separation and ensures a smooth keying process during editing. Choosing a chroma-key background color that contrasts distinctly with the subject’s colors is essential for effective color separation. This prevents unintentional transparency, color spill, and ensures a polished final result.</p><p>Lighting Considerations</p><p>Lighting is an important part of the chroma-keying process. Bold, uniform, and consistent lighting on both the subject and the background makes it easy to delineate one from the other fully. This minimizes shadows and variations in color, creating a smooth and seamless keying process. Multiple diffuse lights from different angles are often used to illuminate the green screen evenly.</p><p>Positioning&#x2F;Camera</p><p>Proper subject and camera placement are necessary to ensure an even color-keying process during post-production. To prevent shadow interference, the green screen should be smooth, tense, and without wrinkles or shadows.</p><p>High-quality cameras are essential every time, especially for chroma keying. Images with better definition are easier to key, so camera quality significantly affects the outcome. Even if your camera isn’t the best, merely shooting well can ensure a clean color-keying process during editing, resulting in professional-looking visuals.</p><h2 id="Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key-1"><a href="#Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key-1" class="headerlink" title="Recording Tips for Chroma Key"></a>Recording Tips for Chroma Key</h2><ul><li>Proper Lighting</li></ul><p>Maintaining uniform and well-defined lighting during recording is essential for a successful chroma-keying process. This consistency ensures a seamless keying process during post-production.</p><ul><li>Keep Distance from the Green Screen</li></ul><p>The optimal distance between the subject and the green screen minimizes color spill and allows for natural movements. Proper distance between subject and background allows for easier isolation of the background and much smoother post-editing. A recommended starting point for the issue is around 6 to 10 feet from the background.</p><ul><li>Subjects and Clothing</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, the choice of costume for Selecting appropriate clothing that doesn’t match the chroma key color prevents transparency issues. Subjects also have to be positioned in such a way that there is minimal light interference and reflection. These contribute to a flawless chroma key outcome.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaGNHfAT92w?si=bvHo1iYK2JBIPtRo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies-1"><a href="#3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies-1" class="headerlink" title="3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies"></a>3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies</h2><ul><li>Color Spill</li></ul><p>Sometimes, reflected light from your green background can be cast on your subject and may remain so when the background light is keyed out. This phenomenon is known as a color spill. It is usually because of uneven lighting or shooting around reflecting surfaces. Avoiding spill can differentiate between good and lousy chroma key aftereffects.</p><p>Human hair is one area where color spill can show up unsuspectingly. Due to the translucency of hair, it is common for some unintended light to seep through. This allows some background visibility, which you do not want with a chroma key. This is especially notable with lighter hair colors like blond hair.</p><p>There are ways to account for this. Many video-editing software have features such as spill suppression and screen matte adjustments that can enhance the final footage. Specialized plugins also go a long way in ensuring minimizing spill. Addressing spill correction tackles unwanted green artifacts and ensures a clean keying process.</p><ul><li>Poor Lighting</li></ul><p>Suboptimal green screen lighting can lead to inconsistencies in keying and editing, undermining your product. One way to avoid this is to light the screen and subject separately. Another tip, although expensive, is using multiple diffuse light sources and trying to maintain even lighting across every square foot of your scene. Super bright or dark spots can ruin your output, so it’s worth the extra effort if you don’t want to deal with problematic post-production.</p><ul><li>Poorly Refined Edges</li></ul><p>Chroma keying should leave your videos with crisp, defined, natural-looking edges. But post-production editing can make all the difference if it doesn’t come out to your taste. Softening and refining edges make a smoother transition between the foreground object and the new background. Light adjustments to edge thickness and screen matte settings can also help enhance overall visual quality and add finesse to your work.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Green screen photography produces excellent results, and its ease of use makes it indispensable for videographers of all levels.

Many businesses make use of YouTube ads to get their products to their customers and it’s really effective. However, you can make more organic traffic using YouTube video marketing. With a successful YouTube video marketing strategy, you can generate leads without any ad investments.</p><p>And in this guide, we will discuss some YouTube video marketing tips that will help you get more subscribers and build your brand outreach.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmQjRcnaq9g?si=jadcGtXemUAlKOTa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal"><a href="#Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal"></a><strong>Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal</strong></h2><p>A roadmap is basically a level by level approach to your vision. Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p><p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKRBWf1EDZo?si=CTNd4q450biit4eM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels. There are some important tests that you can do to understand the genre that you are targeting.</p><h3 id="a-Test-video-duration"><a href="#a-Test-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="a. Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p><p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p><h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p><p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format. For example:</p><p>And many videos that aren’t specifically cooking at all!</p><p>And it is evident that these new formats have also become crowd favorites. Now do all their videos hit the 1 million mark? No, that just shows they are constantly testing out the waters go ahead with what works and discard what doesn’t!</p><h3 id="c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts"><a href="#c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts" class="headerlink" title="c. Try Giveaways and gifts"></a>c. Try Giveaways and gifts</h3><p>You can boost the viewership and subscriber count for your channel by setting up occasional giveaways or gifts to the viewers. Make sure that you set the winning criteria to have the viewers subscribe to the channel.</p><p>For example, let’s take another popular YouTube channel Unbox Therapy. On Jun 27, 2018, the channel did an announcement that they were giving 106 OnePlus 6 smartphones!</p><p>And the result of the announcement was evident in the subscribers count.</p><p>From June 23rd to June 27th, 2018, Unbox therapy had gained 12,583 subscribers. However, from the announcement date that is June 27th to June 30th, 2018, the channel saw an increase of a whopping <a class="link"   href="https://www.trackalytics.com/youtube/user/unboxtherapy/" >52,173 subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>! Till date, the video has over 14 million views</p><p>We do not advise you to try this out when you are just starting your YouTube career. Only venture out to such investments when you are stable when it comes to earnings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xtylXDY9YfA?si=VonzSiDFGCpJm2uC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback"><a href="#Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback"></a><strong>Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback</strong></h2><p>All your videos must be created with the audience in mind. However, sometimes what you may think would work might not fit well with the audience. Hence, it is imperative that you understand their likes and dislikes.</p><p>And the best way to improve your videos is to take suggestions from the audience themselves. You can ask them specific questions on how to improve your videos or what they want to see in your future creations. Take notes on what they have to offer and start building your content taking in those suggestions.</p><p>There is also another facet to incorporating audience feedback as it projects your YouTube channel to be responsive to the audience, something that is vital to building a strong and loyal viewer base on YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cC-HtDQVoG0?si=nQcoa7q8q2IL8U0m" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources"><a href="#Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources" class="headerlink" title="Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources"></a><strong>Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources</strong></h2><p>YouTube has made it easier for you to track the sources from which your videos are getting the views. Sign in to YouTube Studio Beta and the click Reach from the Analytics menu provided on the left panel. Now click on Traffic source types.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Analytics"                ></p><p>In this window, you can see the different sources that led viewers to your video. Generally, it can be a mix of websites, YouTube recommendation’s, YouTube search, etc. Metrics like Watch Time gives you an idea of how long viewers watch your videos and Audience Retention shows how consistent they are at watching them. These are just two of the many metrics you can use to your advantage.</p><p>Analyzing YouTube videos will help you structure your future videos in a way that it is more susceptible to being clicked.</p><h2 id="Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos"><a href="#Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos"></a><strong>Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos</strong></h2><p>You must have an eye on the metrics that your videos garner over the days. While the number of views, likes, and dislikes are great indicators in determining the popularity of the videos, but there are many more factors at play.</p><p>Your video ranking is important as it determines the position of your videos when a keyword is typed into the search box. The ranks are calculated by the YouTube algorithm, but you have a certain degree of power in raising the ranks by leveraging the following parameters of the video;</p><p><strong><em>Thumbnail:</em></strong> The first thing that the viewer is going it see when they are browsing through a list of videos is the thumbnail. Make sure that it is attractive and stands out!</p><p><strong><em>Title:</em></strong> The next element that gets the most attention from both the user and the YouTube algorithm is the title. Ensure that the main keyword you are targeting is included in the title.</p><p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> This is where you can play a lot with keywords, both short and long tail. Be very descriptive about your video, but do not just use a big chunk of text. The description must be succinct and informative. It can also have links to your landing page or sponsors.</p><p><strong><em>Tags:</em></strong> Tags are words or phrases that are used to help YouTube better understand the video. Make sure the tags that you are giving are related to the video that they represent.</p><p><strong><em>Category:</em></strong> YouTube has some predefined categories and the videos that you upload must be put in the right one to get maximum reach.</p><p><strong><em>Subtitles:</em></strong> Subtitles do not carry much weight in terms of SEO or ranking, but they are a much-appreciated addition in the audience point of view.</p><p>Yes, it can be quite meticulous but the results are worth the effort. Having a rank tracker like the one from <a class="link"   href="https://seranking.com/position-tracking.html" >SE Ranking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/tools#keywordranktracking" >Tubebuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be quite handy at times like these.

Make sure the tags that you are giving are related to the video that they represent.</p><p><strong><em>Category:</em></strong> YouTube has some predefined categories and the videos that you upload must be put in the right one to get maximum reach.</p><p><strong><em>Subtitles:</em></strong> Subtitles do not carry much weight in terms of SEO or ranking, but they are a much-appreciated addition in the audience point of view.</p><p>Yes, it can be quite meticulous but the results are worth the effort.
