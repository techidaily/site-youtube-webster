No matter how many followers you may currently have, you are an amazing person just as you are with a unique story. Here are ten <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to share your personal story.</p><ul><li><a href="#one">Channel Trailer</a></li><li><a href="#two">My YouTube Story</a></li><li><a href="#three">Draw My Life</a></li><li><a href="#four">Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#five">Never Have I Ever Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#six">Get Ready With me Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#seven">My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story</a></li><li><a href="#eight">Narrated Autobiopic</a></li><li><a href="#nine">25 Facts About Me</a></li><li><a href="#ten">YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="1-Channel-Trailer"><a href="#1-Channel-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="1.  Channel Trailer"></a>1.  Channel Trailer</h3><p>Before posting any videos on your channel, it can be a great idea to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create a “Channel Trailer” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> summarizing who you are and what your channel is all about.</p><p>YouTuber Shameless Maya does an excellent job of this. She created a visually appealing and engaging 1-2 minute channel trailer that explains exactly what her channel is all about. Feel free to be as creative as you want to be.</p><h3 id="2-My-YouTube-Story"><a href="#2-My-YouTube-Story" class="headerlink" title="2.  My YouTube Story"></a>2.  My YouTube Story</h3><p>On Monday, May 17th, 2010, YouTube celebrated its fifth anniversary. In celebration of hitting their five-year mark, YouTube launched a “My YouTube Story” campaign, which featured fifteen YouTubers sharing how YouTube has changed their lives. Each of these videos would end with “What’s your YouTube story? Tell us by uploading a video.” Ever since that campaign, many YouTubers have shared their YouTube story, including me! After I had been on YouTube for two years, I felt it was time for me to share my own YouTube story with the world. Sharing your story is not only an opportunity for your viewers to get to know you but a way to inspire other creators to start their channels as well. We all have our reasons for why we started, so why not share them?</p><h3 id="3-Draw-My-Life"><a href="#3-Draw-My-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Draw My Life"></a>3.  Draw My Life</h3><p>“Draw My Life” is a popular video where YouTubers share their life stories through a unique series of drawings. Often YouTubers use a white dry erase board and markers so they can erase and redraw the series of their life events. Mr. Kate provides a great example of this as she is a talented artist and DIY’er. The great thing about this is you don’t have to be an artist or a great drawer. It’s a fun way to be creative and tell your story.</p><h3 id="4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A"><a href="#4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="4.  Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A"></a>4.  Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A</h3><p>Who isn’t on Snapchat, Instagram, or both these days? Over the past year, I’ve seen YouTubers get creative by asking their viewers to send snaps asking questions they will answer on a Q &amp; A video on their channel. This video idea is great because it involves live viewer participation and a chance for viewers to be seen or noticed on their favorite Youtuber’s channels. Beauty guru stars Manny MUA and Jeffrey Star did a great example of this as a collaboration.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/td3ojuzhloY?si=N_maQNiJWrJp7XZl&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A"><a href="#5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="5.  Never Have I Ever Q &amp; A"></a>5.  Never Have I Ever Q &amp; A</h3><p>Who hasn’t played the “Never Have I Ever” game?! Playing this game as a Q &amp; A is a great way for viewers to get to know you better with some juicy and shocking details about yourself they otherwise wouldn’t know. It’s also a great way to play and collaborate with another YouTuber. Often, the questions will be split and you have to watch both YouTubers’ videos to find out all the details. Highly popular beauty YouTuber Desi Perkins does a great example of this while playing the game with her sister in law.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBCobAYzzcc?si=J3eSTQ3AdyxWAjGo&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A"><a href="#6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="6.  Get Ready With Me Q &amp; A"></a>6.  Get Ready With Me Q &amp; A</h3><p>Get ready with me Q &amp; As are some of my favorite videos to watch because it’s nice to see YouTubers strip-down bare-faced to do their makeup and answer popular questions. It often feels like two old friends sitting down to chat. Jenn, I’m doing a great example of this when she took to twitter asking viewers to ask her questions she would answer on her channel. Not only did she answer the questions but she gave a detailed makeup tutorial and explanation of the products she used as a 2 for 1. Even if your channel has nothing to do with makeup or fashion, some viewers can still be intrigued to learn more about your fashion and makeup style.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uSfA74aeYeA?si=HdJSMdeS7HVtS6-j&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story"><a href="#7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story" class="headerlink" title="7.  My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story"></a>7.  My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story</h3><p>Behind all their smiles and outrageous on-camera personas, there are a lot of YouTubers who are dealing with depression and anxiety. Beauty and fashion YouTuber Alyssa Forever not only shared her story on how she dealt with her depression but gave tips and ways to be happier. If you are facing depression, anxiety, or some other mental illness, it can give others hope if you share your story.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xa2_mFu-obA?si=_xDGF1pv-dnuaDOr&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Narrated-Autobiopic"><a href="#8-Narrated-Autobiopic" class="headerlink" title="8.  Narrated Autobiopic"></a>8.  Narrated Autobiopic</h3><p>Narrated Autobiopic videos are a great way to share your story or advice in a cinematic way. You can be as creative as you want to be. YouTuber Evelyn From the Internets posted a narrated autobiopic called “For People Who Feel Behind In Life” that comically introduces her story.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eu4vwlZcMvM?si=4vEczfVU4BUUFP-t&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-25-Facts-About-Me-Tag"><a href="#9-25-Facts-About-Me-Tag" class="headerlink" title="9.  25 Facts About Me Tag"></a>9.  25 Facts About Me Tag</h3><p>This is probably one of the easiest ways to share things about yourself when starting as a YouTuber or even if you’re a veteran. Viewers are always looking to learn more interesting things about you so you are more relatable. I’ve been a fan of Vasseur Beauty for a few years now and was surprised by many of the things she shared about herself.</p><h3 id="10-YouTube-Live-Webinar"><a href="#10-YouTube-Live-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="10.  YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar"></a>10.  YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar</h3><p>YouTube live videos are probably the best ways to interact and share your story with viewers. Viewers can ask questions on the spot. YouTuber Roberto Blake shares great live videos on how to improve your videos and things he’s learned through personal experience.</p><h2 id="Custom-Your-Video-with-Excellent-Video-Editor"><a href="#Custom-Your-Video-with-Excellent-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Custom Your Video with Excellent Video Editor"></a>Custom Your Video with Excellent Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-a-deep-dive-into-durecorders-full-range/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved A Deep Dive Into DuRecorder's Full Range</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-construct-chuckles-adobe-meme-creation/"><u>[New] Construct Chuckles Adobe Meme Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-dual-display-dominance-top-videographer-verdict-for-2024/"><u>[New] Dual Display Dominance Top Videographer Verdict for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-cam-cover-selection/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Cam Cover Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ourney-to-digital-reach-the-complete-process-of-starting-a-youtube-channel-for-2024/"><u>[New] Journey to Digital Reach The Complete Process of Starting a YouTube Channel for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-memo-menagerie-the-ultimate-list-of-meme-generators/"><u>[New] Memo Menagerie The Ultimate List of Meme Generators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/uick-record-and-publish-screen-images-for-macpc-and-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] Quick Record & Publish Screen Images for Mac/PC and YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-transcription-aid-for-your-youtube-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Best Transcription Aid for Your YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-examining-youtubes-copyright-stance-versus-cc-approach-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Examining Youtube's Copyright Stance Versus CC Approach for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-capture-clarity-high-quality-screen-recordings-for-youtubers-pcmac/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Capture Clarity High-Quality Screen Recordings for YouTubers (PC/Mac)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-infallible-way-to-forbid-youtubes-snappy-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Infallible Way to Forbid YouTube's Snappy Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-visionaries-inventing-new-marvel-worlds/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Visionaries Inventing New Marvel Worlds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/how-to-flawlessly-install-nvidias-newest-drivers-for-rtx-2070-super-windows-11-edition/"><u>How to Flawlessly Install NVIDIA's Newest Drivers for RTX 2070 Super: Windows 11 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-effortless-webm-creation-10-best-youtube-video-transformers/"><u>In 2024, Effortless WebM Creation 10 Best YouTube Video Transformers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgotten-the-voicemail-password-of-infinix-zero-5g-2023-turbo-try-these-fixes-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Forgotten The Voicemail Password Of Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo?

Firstly because it means you have to do all the work of shooting and editing every day and secondly because it means you need to have something to talk about every single day. Even vlogging once or twice a week is tough.</p><p>How do you know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what you should talk about in your vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? Some people are so comfortable in front of the camera they can just turn it on and start talking about whatever’s on their mind, but they’re in the minority.</p><p>Before starting your daily vlogging, you have to figure out one important thing ahead of time.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Do-you-have-a-niche"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-niche" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a niche?"></a>Do you have a niche?</h2><p>  You should have a niche. In a genre as broad as vlogging it is important to have some kind of hook that sets you apart from other vloggers. This can be an interest that you have, an industry you work in, or even a field of study you’re involved in at school. If you’re into technology, for example, you’ll always have a wealth of subjects to vlog about because all you’ll have to do is look at the day’s tech news and make a video reporting and commenting on it.</p><p>The other reason it’s good to have a niche is that you’ll be able to use keywords related to that niche in your video titles and tags. It’s hard to make it with a vlogging channel because nobody is searching for your content unless you are covering a specific topic like the technology they want to hear about.</p><ul><li><a href="#watching">What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</a></li><li><a href="#snapshots">Snapshots of Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#get-out">Whatever You Need to Get Out</a></li><li><a href="#learn">What did you learn today?</a></li></ul><p>Here are 4 things to talk about in your daily vlog:</p><h2 id="What-are-you-watching-reading"><a href="#What-are-you-watching-reading" class="headerlink" title="What are you watching&#x2F;reading?"></a>What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</h2><p> If you’re really into a book or tv show, or if you saw a movie recently, then those are all good things to talk about (warn people if you’re going to spoil anything!). You do recaps, reviews, or just share a few thoughts you had. If you’re worried about alienating people who don’t watch&#x2F;read the same stuff as you then you can keep it more general and just react to a few things from the media you’re consuming while also talking about your day. It’ll give you an anchor to build the rest of your video around, even if it’s not all you talk about.</p><p>By commenting on what you’re watching&#x2F;reading you have a better chance of capitalizing on a trending topic people are searching for. You could also find yourself an audience by becoming involved in fan communities.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LW6wNx3XAj8?si=VaIuFIIx8MM_RhUR&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Snapshots-of-Your-Day"><a href="#Snapshots-of-Your-Day" class="headerlink" title="Snapshots of Your Day"></a>Snapshots of Your Day</h2><p> Casey Neistat is the master of this. He is always ready with a camera on hand so that, when something interesting happens, he can capture it and build his daily vlog around it.</p><p>Carrying a camera around like Casey may or may not suit your lifestyle, but you can still pick out one story from your day to tell. It doesn’t have to be a major event, and you shouldn’t worry that it won’t be interesting to other people. It’s your personality they’re tuning in for, so even if you’re just talking about a funny thing your cat did it will keep your audience interested because a) it’s you talking about it and b) it gives them a bit of insight into your life.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkdZ3A1mock?si=2zeR5GtTU2VujM_w&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out"><a href="#Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out" class="headerlink" title="Whatever You Need to Get Out"></a>Whatever You Need to Get Out</h2><p><em>Flula is frequently puzzled by English expressions, like ‘Party Pooper’, and needs to get his confusion off his chest at odd hours of the day.</em></p><p> Ranting about people you know can get messy when people from your offline life see it, so maybe avoid that. However, if you’re angry about something in general – or really happy about something – then whatever it is you’re feeling strongly about is probably the thing you should be vlogging about.</p><p>It does not matter what it is that is making you have this strong reaction (unless, again, it’s an actual person who might see your video and cause problems for you). If you’re mad about a real injustice in the world then that’s a great thing to talk about – you might even raise some awareness for the issue – but you can also rant about your favorite flavor of yogurt being cut and that’ll be engaging to viewers too.</p><p>Alternatively: you could do a vlog about how happy you are to have gotten engaged or a vlog about how happy you are that it was sunny today, and your enthusiasm will carry your audience through either video with you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdVT_-3gESA?si=_HfjpbUEHSRKTXjt&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-did-you-learn-today"><a href="#What-did-you-learn-today" class="headerlink" title="What did you learn today?"></a>What did you learn today?</h2><p> <em>Fun fact: The original lyrics Paul McCartney imagined for ‘Yesterday’ were ‘Scrambled eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs’.</em></p><p> You learn something new every day, right? Why not share that factoid with your viewers. Here a few facts to get you started:</p><p> Whales evolved from a land-based animal called a pakicetus.</p><p>The hagfish hunt by swimming into the mouth of a larger fish and eating it from the inside.</p><p>Crows live in family units, visit their aging parents, and have funerals for dead crows.</p><p>The puya chilensis is a plant that ‘eats’ sheep (sheep get stuck to it, starve, and end up as fertilizer).</p><p>Sea monkeys can survive in space.</p><h2 id="EVERYTHING"><a href="#EVERYTHING" class="headerlink" title="EVERYTHING"></a>EVERYTHING</h2><p>You could also just flick the camera on and tell the full story of your day like you’d do in a traditional daily blog. What did you have for breakfast, how was school&#x2F;work, did you talk to any friends, how was the weather – anything and everything. Generally, these videos can run a bit long and don’t have a lot of snappy editing. They’re faster to make, which is good if you’re doing them every day, but the unpolished nature of them won’t appeal to everyone. It will be exactly what appeals to some people, though.</p><h2 id="Customize-Your-Vlog-Stories-with-Powerful-Video-Editor"><a href="#Customize-Your-Vlog-Stories-with-Powerful-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Customize Your Vlog Stories with Powerful Video Editor"></a>Customize Your Vlog Stories with Powerful Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Iv3DjT2Fyw?si=pR_z8ZDDVGF2MvKJ&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;

So if you are a cooking aficionado, you have excellent potential to gain positive attention and a loyal audience. But to create engaging videos, you’d need a lot more than excellent culinary skills. This article aims to enlighten aspiring food and recipe vloggers about the essentials of video making straight out of the oven, to create enriched content that’s professional, neat, and viral-worthy.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Tips to Make Your Cooking Videos Stand Out</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Promote Your Cooking Channel on YouTube?</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aknYnDfODro?si=zONIVzA9FFq0rLOD&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Prepare-Before-Making-a-Recipe-Video"><a href="#What-to-Prepare-Before-Making-a-Recipe-Video" class="headerlink" title="What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video"></a>What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video</h2><p>While you would know best about the prep work needed for the recipes, the prep work for making a video starts with a plan. What goes into the plan?</p><p>Brainstorm this equation - <strong>Main Content + Duration + Light + Sound + Camera + Camera Angle, Shots &amp; Transition</strong>.</p><p><strong>The main content is how you picture the finished video</strong>. Ask yourself - Do you want an intro gig? Are you going to talk in the video or show only hands and the cooking with a piece of background music? How do you wish to present the ingredients? Would there be additional tips? At what platform are you going to publish your content? How long should be your clippings? Consider all these questions to chalk out a basic framework of your video</p><p><strong>The camera is a pivotal element</strong>. Whether it is a smartphone or a hi-fidelity digital camera, it is worthwhile to familiarise the best positions and light orientations and the capacity of the device to produce the best quality picture.</p><p><strong>How is your sound going to be like?</strong> If you are going to talk in the video, it is recommended that you use a microphone. Or else, you can also use background sound. But to mix sound with the video, you’d need an excellent sound editing tool.</p><p>Finally, comes the editing and finishing part. Eventually, you’ll need purposive video-editing software to help you work out the video transitions, sound, and visual effects.<strong>Choose a toolkit that is easy to learn</strong> and that you can get comfortable with so that the job of video editing doesn’t take the focus away from the main task of cooking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recipe-videos.jpg"                      alt="Recipe Videos"                ></p><p>Now, once you have all the essential ingredients to create your video, start practicing. Remember that it is the most natural thing for the first videos to appear amateurish or inept. And that is part of the plan. Don’t be disheartened and keep going.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15TKQ-BOENI?si=Ri4B2AuxAdi0Bglz&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Make-a-Cooking-Video-with-Filmora-a-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Make-a-Cooking-Video-with-Filmora-a-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide"></a>Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>As one of the easiest-to-use video editing tools, the full-featured Filmora is the right choice considering it can fit most of your needs.

Consider spills, drops, overcooking, etc. as part of the process, so keep adequate substitutes to continue with your project unwaveringly. If you are using a phone, keep it fully charged up. And have a plan beforehand about what you should do when you get an urgent call while shooting. Also, consider doing a site investigation of the shooting spot for any fragile items, pointy corners, slippery areas, curious pets, etc. to avoid trips and falls in the middle of the filming, especially when working with a cameraman who’s following your movement. If you are using a tripod, and floor-standing lights, remember to secure the equipment with plenty of adhesive tapes, lest they bump into an expensive trip or fall.</p><h4 id="Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora"><a href="#Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora"></a>Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora</h4><p>You need to sync the device that you used to film the video with the computer that has Filmora installed. It may be a phone or a camcorder. Once the devices are synced, you should launch the Filmora software and go the <strong>“Media”</strong> button at the top right toolbar. There you will find the <strong>“Import”</strong> button. You will get a pop-up message asking you to choose the type of device. Select the right one, and your video will be imported in the Filmora interface.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion"></a>Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion</h4><p>To create crisp, fast-paced videos, you don’t have to gobble up the content eyeing at the duration. Think smart when you have the resources of a tool like Filmora. Here are the three best features that help you create fast-paced yet well-defined recipes.</p><p><strong>Time-Lapse:</strong> The time-lapse feature allows you to adjust the speed of the video from slow-motion to 10x faster. To use this, double click on a specific clip in your imported video and open the custom speed settings. Use the adjusting meter beside speed to make your clip as fast or slow as you want. You may use the same feature to introduce the slow-motion effects in certain areas of the video.</p><p>Now, when you are using either the fast-forward or slow-motion effects, it is best to have stable video footage with consistent lighting and a static background. There are also the options of Reverse Speed that can play the clip backward, as in flash-back. The Ripple edit feature allows you to cut short a long clip seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Jump Cut:</strong> The Jump Cut is about snipping unwanted areas in the clip. It may sound like the Ripple edit mentioned above, but the ripple edit is more functional for cutting short a continuous video so that the viewer won’t realize the snip. For the Jump Cut, it doesn’t have to be a constant clip. You can get to the next frame or scene with an abracadabra move.</p><p>To use Jump Cut, place the cursor over the starting of the clip that you want to cut, and right-click on it and select <strong>“Split”</strong> (the <strong>“scissors”</strong> feature on the toolbar does the same thing).

You should also keep an eye on the length and file size limits. The more basic things you need to consider carefully when you upload are the title, description, and tags of your video. These are part of what determines if and where your video comes up in people’s search results. There are also slightly more advanced video specs, like your video’s resolution, which will be helpful for you to understand as somebody who will be producing video content frequently. These sorts of specs will affect how long it takes your videos to upload and how much of the quality they maintain.</p><h4 id="1-How-Long-Can-my-Video-Be"><a href="#1-How-Long-Can-my-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="1.  How Long Can my Video Be?"></a>1.  How Long Can my Video Be?</h4><p>By default, your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long. You can post longer videos by going to the upload page and clicking on ‘Increase your Limit’ at the bottom. After you have followed the steps to verify your account you will be able to post videos that are a maximum of 11 hours long.</p><h4 id="2-How-Big-a-File-Can-I-Upload"><a href="#2-How-Big-a-File-Can-I-Upload" class="headerlink" title="2.  How Big a File Can I Upload?"></a>2.  How Big a File Can I Upload?</h4><p>Your file size was capped at 20GB, initially. If you follow the same steps for posting videos longer than 15 minutes then you can also increase your maximum file size to 128GB.</p><h4 id="3-Other-Basics"><a href="#3-Other-Basics" class="headerlink" title="3.  Other Basics"></a>3.  Other Basics</h4><p>After you click the ‘upload’ button on YouTube you are taken to a page where you choose a category for your video and add a title, description, and tags. These are all important for getting hits so you should put some thought into them.</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Keep your title under 70 characters so none of it disappears into a ‘…’. The best titles make people curious or elicit an emotional response. Terms like ‘video’, ‘how-to’, and ‘tutorial’ are often typed into people’s searches so if they apply to your video it can help to put them in the title.</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> A short synopsis of your video which includes your most important keyword. You have about three lines before your text is hidden by a ‘show more’ tab. If you are including the URL of your channel or other videos then you should make sure they are above the ‘show more’.</p><p> <strong>Tags:</strong> Use a lot of them. These are the keywords and terms people will be searching for when they find your video. YouTube will suggest some after you start adding. A quick way to find good keywords to use is to search for videos similar to yours and check out their tags. A while ago YouTube started hiding video tags by default but you can download a free, YouTube-certified, extension for Google Chrome which will allow you to see them from vidIQ.com.</p><h4 id="4-Digging-Deeper"><a href="#4-Digging-Deeper" class="headerlink" title="4.  Digging Deeper"></a>4.  Digging Deeper</h4><p>To get your viewers to subscribe to your channel you will need to make sure your videos are not losing quality when you upload them. Here are some things to be aware of if you want your videos to look great on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> the number of pixels in your image. For example when a video has a resolution of 1080p that means it has a grid of pixels that is 1920 x 1080. The more pixels you have the sharper your image.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong>  Bitrate is a measurement of how compressed your file is, and the less compressed it is the more information there is per frame. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes.</p><p>Your <strong>resolution</strong> and <strong>bitrate</strong> should complement each other. If you have a higher bitrate than is needed for your video’s resolution your file will be unnecessarily large. If your bitrate is too low for your resolution then you will not see the quality you expect.</p><p>YouTube has a list of recommended resolutions and bitrates at support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;answer&#x2F;1722171.</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> the dimensions of your video, in terms of width and height. YouTube’s aspect ratio is 16:9, so your videos should also be 16:9. If they are not then you will get black bars on either side of your video after you upload it. The most common way that people end up with the wrong aspect ratio is by creating videos on their smartphones and holding them up and down instead of sideways.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3PFn06LijE?si=zHrmlTOzrKxXe-k4&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube"></a>Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube</h2><p>Uploading YouTube Video on Desktop:</p><p>1.

The <strong>sign-in</strong> button is located at the top right corner of the YouTube homepage. If you have multiple accounts registered to one device, you will be asked to choose one to log in to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-signin.jpg"                      alt="sign in YouTube account"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Hit-the-upload-button"><a href="#Step-2-Hit-the-upload-button" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Hit the upload button"></a>Step 2: Hit the upload button</h4><p>It is a simple step that you will have to follow right after you log in to YouTube. As soon as you enter YouTube, after using your Google account and password for login, you will find the upload button in the top right corner of the screen. Click on this button and it will take you to the dedicated upload page.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Select-your-video-type-Public-Private-Unlisted"><a href="#Step-3-Select-your-video-type-Public-Private-Unlisted" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Select your video type (Public, Private, Unlisted)"></a>Step 3: Select your video type (Public, Private, Unlisted)</h4><p>Choose your audience. If you wish to make your video available to everyone on YouTube, simply go to the privacy settings and choose the <strong>“Public”</strong> option from the drop-down menu.</p><p>If you do not want your video to be searchable, but still want to be able to easily share a link to it with your friends and family, choose the <strong>“Unlisted”</strong> option.</p><p>Those who wish to keep their video personal can choose the <strong>“Private</strong>” option from the drop-down menu. You can still share a private video with a limited number of people (as long as they have Google accounts).</p><p>The <strong>“Scheduled”</strong> option is available for choosing a future date and time to make the video available to viewers. Once you have selected your privacy level, simply upload your video from your device storage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-youtube-privacy-setting.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Upload"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpnYKIrpgZQ?si=94zicAHp1CH-0oso&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Step-4-Manage-the-upload"><a href="#Step-4-Manage-the-upload" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Manage the upload"></a>Step 4: Manage the upload</h4><p>As soon as you have confirmed your video upload, you will find a progress bar on the screen. It will take some time depending on factors such as the resolution of the video and how long it is. In the meanwhile, you can write a title, description and add relevant tags for your video so that YouTube knows what search results to include it in and viewers can find it. Remember that YouTube is the second biggest search engine on the Internet, so take some time to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >optimize your keywords <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Choose-your-thumbnail"><a href="#Step-5-Choose-your-thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Choose your thumbnail"></a>Step 5: Choose your thumbnail</h4><p>Once your video uploading is complete, it is time to choose a creative thumbnail for your video. The system provides you with three options to choose from automatically, all of which will be screenshots from your video. It is usually better to<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload your own custom thumbnail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as thumbnails are a very important factor in attracting viewers.

Licenses have conditions, but they should not affect your ability to use royalty free music in your vlog. The most common condition for using royalty free music is that you need to credit the artist, which can be as simple as including a ‘music by’ note in your video’s description.</p><p>Because royalty free music still has a copyright claim on it YouTube may occasionally flag your video even though you are only using music you are allowed to use. YouTube’s flagging system is automated and prone to error. If your video is incorrectly flagged you can dispute it with YouTube and get your video cleared again.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVsiIO7hWOc?si=UvWnqxaI_yHwEr74&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos</h2><h3 id="1-YouTube-Audio-Library"><a href="#1-YouTube-Audio-Library" class="headerlink" title="1.

But today the software industry has given us well-equipped tools for video making or editing. Video editors are on huge demand in various sectors starting from academics to business professions.

Social platforms like Youtube and Instagram are filled with such creative content. It gives the person a unique opportunity to show his&#x2F;her talent in front of everyone with the help of these tools. The most important thing in the case of <strong>parody video</strong> is there is no requirement of professional editing knowledge to make the creative videos.</p><p>Click here to see <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Songs That Totally Crack You Up. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The “Import” option available on the timeline will do all the procedures alone. The user will not have to worry about anything. Importing is the starting procedure of video editing. There are plenty of additional features available on the same page of the program. Once the array of files is uploaded, the files are dragged and dropped in the timeline where they will be now subjected to be produced and shared. There will be no hassle to get access to the videos. All the imported files are available in the right place. The thumbnail on the left item tray will comprise of all the videos and audio clips. The user can easily obtain them and there will be no confusion.</p><p><strong>History of Parody:</strong></p><p>The history of Parody is very old, it comes from ancient Greece. At that time Battle of the Frogs and Mice hold in which unknown poet reproduces the epic style of Homer.</p><p><strong>Successful influencer of music video parody- Bart Baker</strong></p><p>Bart Baker is the king of the video parody. <strong>Bart Baker</strong> has his own YouTube channel and there you can find his videos. Few of his videos have followers more than 100 million.</p><p><strong>Few of his videos are as below:</strong></p><ol><li>The Chainsmokers ft.

Daft Punk</strong></p><p>After listening to the vietsub, startboy saw it cursing me. After listening to the start-up bart, I saw the weeknd calling myself happy. Very nice invention.</p><p>Youtube link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOwGMpIv8LU" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOwGMpIv8LU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Why his videos are the best:</strong></p><p>Bart Baker is an American artist, web-based comedian, video producer, singer, and parody artist. He is best known for making parody videos of notable songs, which he posts on his YouTube channel. He was described as one of the most prolific creators of musical parodies by Billboard. In addition to being active on YouTube, Baker is known for his short videos on Vine and also on Live.ly, where he is the most winning broadcaster. His videos are described as “high-quality parodies that keep the originals very well.” His videos are famous because they are a great source of entertainment for users. Every age people like his videos.</p><p><strong>How to make a parody video?</strong></p><p>If you want to know <strong>how to make a parody video</strong> then follow the below steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Finding the perfect song:</strong></li><li><strong>Getting the correct music:</strong> To get the right music, Youtube will be a suitable platform.</li><li><strong>Recording suitable lyrics:</strong> The lyrics can be recorded with the help of a microphone in-built with computers. In the absence of a microphone, a video camera will do the work as a substitute. The operating system running under Windows will give the option of Windows movie maker as the recording tool. GarageBand and iMovie will serve the purpose if the user has a Mac operating device. The ultimate goal is a smooth recording. The area of the recording should be soundproof or should have minimum external noise interference. The professional studios have soundproof walls of the rooms for recording. But this is not the case here. Any quiet place is sufficiently suitable for the recording. The pitch and quality of the voice must not be too rough or too fast. Practicing for a few cycles before the final recording will be perfect.</li><li><strong>Making a music video:</strong> The newly created parody will get the maximum benefit if it collaborates with a music video. Only with the help of a video camera, the filming can be done. There should be proper sync between the music video and the parody. Before filming everything should be planned. The location of the shoot should be confirmed beforehand. The background should meet the theme of the song and parody. It is required to carry all the costumes and props to the location of the shoot. Once the video is shot, now it is time for attaching the two clips to make a single impactful video. Use powerful video editing tools to get what you want- Filmora can help you make it.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Today Youtube is the most prominent platform where people can utilize their video editing skills.

The most important element is obviously you, the creator.

The interface is intuitive enough that you may not always need them, but having them should erase any confusion.</p><p>All of the basic editing features, like cutting clips up, are easy to access in the timeline. You have unlimited tracks, and it’s easy to drag your clips between them. There’s a helpful magnet feature that fits clips together if you slide them together, but which still allows for blank space if you choose to leave it.</p><p>Most other functions – setting volume levels, adjusting the speed, adding movement&#x2F;zoom effect – are accessible simply by right-clicking on your clip in the timeline and choosing what you want from the menu that pops up.</p><h4 id="Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>OpenShot is a great, free, choice for YouTubers at any editing skill level.</p><p>Beyond simply ordering your clips, OpenShot includes text and transition options within the program. You can even animate the text, and access Animated Titles if you use OpenShot in tandem with a free animation program called Blender. Titles and transitions are vital to a lot of popular YouTube styles.</p><p>OpenShot does not provide the same level of detail as the runner up, Shotcut, when it comes to color correction or audio editing. However, the features it does have (volume levels, control of saturation) will satisfy most YouTubers.</p><h2 id="2-Shotcut-–-Open-Source-Windows-Mac-Linux"><a href="#2-Shotcut-–-Open-Source-Windows-Mac-Linux" class="headerlink" title="2. Shotcut – Open Source (Windows, Mac, Linux)"></a><strong>2. <a class="link"   href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – Open Source (Windows, Mac, Linux)</strong></h2><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Detailed audio editing</li><li>Color grading, ability to save presets</li><li>Fairly intuitive timeline</li></ol><h4 id="Shotcut-Review"><a href="#Shotcut-Review" class="headerlink" title="Shotcut Review"></a><strong>Shotcut Review</strong></h4><p>Shotcut delivers a smooth, detailed, editing experience for free. It is not as easy to jump into as some of the other programs on this list, but it still only takes a half-hour or so of playing around to understand it well enough to make a video. There are also tutorials up on Shotcut’s site that can help you.</p><p>You can edit using multiple video tracks in Shotcut, making it easy to combine multiple clips, and basic functions like splitting or copying clips are as easy as clicking the right icon on the toolbar.</p><p>All of the video and audio effects, including things like chroma key, you might want to apply to your video are found under the Filters menu. It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p><h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p><p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there). You can get them from elsewhere and use them in the program (Shotcut has an alpha channel), but it’s a bit more involved a process than simply customizing something that’s already provided.</p><h2 id="3-Hitfilm-Express-–-Windows-Mac"><a href="#3-Hitfilm-Express-–-Windows-Mac" class="headerlink" title="3. Hitfilm Express – Windows, Mac"></a><strong>3. <a class="link"   href="https://hitfilm.com/express" >Hitfilm Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – Windows, Mac</strong></h2><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Compositing mode (2D and 3D)</li><li>The Most effect customization</li><li>Helpful User Guide &amp; tutorials</li></ol><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Can be overwhelming</li><li>Its main strength is FX, but you only get a couple for free. Most have to be bought separately.</li></ol><h4 id="Hitfilm-Express-Review"><a href="#Hitfilm-Express-Review" class="headerlink" title="Hitfilm Express Review"></a><strong>Hitfilm Express Review</strong></h4><p>Hitfilm Express is the best free editor if you want to add special effects to your projects. OpenShot’s alpha channel will be enough for most people, but if you think of yourself as an aspiring filmmaker then it’s hard to beat Hitfilm’s range of functions.</p><p>This is an editor designed for people who want to make movies, and it’s a lot more intuitive than most professional-grade software. Film-quality FX (lasers, explosions, etc.) are available through Hitfilm Express for a reasonable price ($10-$50, depending on what you want), and even without paying extra for the packs, there’s a lot you can do to give your video a ‘film look’ using compositing layers and the multitude of customizable effects provided through the program.</p><p>Another highlight of Hitfilm Express is the extensive selection of tutorials and helpful information they have available both through YouTube videos and their User Guide. You will need those because this program can be overwhelming. It has so many functions and areas you can customize that it is easy to get lost.</p><p>That said, basic editing in Hitfilm Express is not difficult to jump into. It’s only when you start getting fancy that things get dicey.</p><h4 id="Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Yes. It will not be the best option for everyone, but it’s not a bad option for anyone either.</p><p>If what you want to make is a vlog where you have a series of clips, and intro, and maybe a couple of title effects, then Hitfilm express might be overkill. You don’t want to have to master compositing just to add some text.</p><p>If what you want to make is a vlog that’s interrupted by an alien invasion and turns into an action sequence with lasers and falling debris, it’d be hard to do better than Hitfilm Express.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xGqSETroqA?si=4C1GPgXi-AksR_oO&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-VideoPad-Video-Editor-–-Windows"><a href="#4-VideoPad-Video-Editor-–-Windows" class="headerlink" title="4. VideoPad Video Editor – Windows"></a><strong>4. <a class="link"   href="http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html" >VideoPad Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – Windows</strong></h2><h4 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Easy to jump into</li><li>Moving text</li><li>Huge audio waveforms</li><li>Audio and visual effects</li><li>Lossless exports</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>No longer updated</li></ol><h4 id="VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="VideoPad Video Editor Review"></a><strong>VideoPad Video Editor Review</strong></h4><p>VideoPad Video Editor is an extremely easy to use program. It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them). Part of its simplicity comes from not being as feature-rich as the programs ranking higher than it on this list, however.</p><p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p><p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p><p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p><h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p><p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p><h2 id="5-Lightworks-–-Windows-Mac-Linux"><a href="#5-Lightworks-–-Windows-Mac-Linux" class="headerlink" title="5. Lightworks – Windows, Mac, Linux"></a><strong>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – Windows, Mac, Linux</strong></h2><h4 id="Pros-4"><a href="#Pros-4" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Detailed color and audio editing</li><li>Multicam editing</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Exports limited to 720p for the free version</li><li>Difficult to learn compared to other free software</li></ol><h4 id="Lightworks-Review"><a href="#Lightworks-Review" class="headerlink" title="Lightworks Review"></a><strong>Lightworks Review</strong></h4><p>On their website, Lightworks claims to have an ‘intuitive interface’ and ‘easy timeline editing’. This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p><p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p><p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’. It is the most professional program on this list, and it’s a great free alternative to something like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p><em>Note:</em> there is no time limit on the free version of Lightworks, but it will ask you to renew your free license every 7 days. When it says your license is ‘expired’ it isn’t kicking you off the free version, you just need to renew.</p><h4 id="Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightworks good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Lightworks good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Whether or not Lightworks is right for your YouTube channel depends on your goals as a video editor.</p><p>If what you want is to jump in and start making YouTube videos quickly, Lightworks might not be a great choice. It’s not an easy program to just jump into, you’ll have to either take time to learn it or accept that it’ll take some trial and error to get the hang of.</p><p>If what you want is to become a professional-level video editor, then Lightworks is a great program to start on (although, Hitfilm Express may still be better). Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p><p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OZQJUTr44rA?si=ADA0nD1VnXjR_sH0&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-VSDC-Video-Editor-–-Windows"><a href="#6-VSDC-Video-Editor-–-Windows" class="headerlink" title="6.

Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p><p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p><p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p><h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2cXnI9oOvM?si=3nz2sBB124ln-83T&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows" class="headerlink" title="7.

It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p><p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p><p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p><h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p><p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p><p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p><p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p><p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASUEYpqSP5E?si=0KOZxrTVexTuUkRn&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD"><a href="#8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD" class="headerlink" title="8.

I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p><p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p><p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p><h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p><p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p><p> What has your experience with free video editors been like?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-unlocking-secrets-for-superior-asmr-viewing/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unlocking Secrets for Superior ASMR Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/one-your-livestream-skills-on-youtubes-premier-platform-for-2024/"><u>[New] Hone Your Livestream Skills on YouTube's Premier Platform for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/astering-youtubes-defense-confronting-critics-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering YouTube's Defense Confronting Critics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-the-enhanced-ultrablade-samsungs-2023-take/"><u>[New] The Enhanced UltraBlade Samsung’s 2023 Take</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-an-uninterrupted-viewing-experience-set-up-youtube-autoplay-on-fb-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Crafting an Uninterrupted Viewing Experience Set Up Youtube Autoplay on FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-elevating-positivity-in-a-constructive-space/"><u>[Updated] Elevating Positivity in a Constructive Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-explore-the-finest-15-video-cameras-for-vlogging-success/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Explore the Finest 15 Video Cameras for Vlogging Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-data.techidaily.com/1728490898993-hddssd/"><u>「使用済み領域を選別してHDDからSSDに転送するテクニック」</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-free-youtube-end-screen-templates-plushow-tos/"><u>2024 Approved Free YouTube End Screen Templates [+How-Tos]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-leading-techniques-for-effective-webp-to-jpeg-change/"><u>2024 Approved Leading Techniques for Effective WebP to JPEG Change</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/best-free-wmv-video-combining-software-for-2024/"><u>Best Free WMV Video Combining Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/practices-boosting-your-game-videos-with-tags-for-2024/"><u>Best Practices Boosting Your Game Videos with Tags for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/deep-dive-into-sharex-feedback-and-substitutes-for-2024/"><u>Deep Dive Into ShareX Feedback & Substitutes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-uncover-hidden-youtube-discussions/"><u>In 2024, Uncover Hidden YouTube Discussions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/scopri-come-usare-freecam-2024-con-la-tua-guida-definitiva-scaricabile-gratuitamente-ora/"><u>Scopri Come Usare FreeCam 2024 Con La Tua Guida Definitiva: Scaricabile Gratuitamente Ora!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/egies-for-monetizing-your-content-without-infringement/"><u>Strategies for Monetizing Your Content Without Infringement</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Unlisted videos will not be included in any of the Google search engine results and only individuals that have the link will be able to view the videos on YouTube. A person does not have to have a Google account or any type of password to see unlisted videos, only the link, which means the people you share the video with will also be able to share it with whoever they like.</p><p>To share an unlisted video, simply send its URL to anyone you want to watch it. This is easier than sharing private YouTube videos, but not quite as private.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBCobAYzzcc?si=J3eSTQ3AdyxWAjGo&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;

From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;</p><p><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mile):</strong> CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.</p><p>Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.</p><p>All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.</p><p>You can also calculate your YouTube channel total earnings by using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tunepocket.com/youtube-money-calculator/" >YouTube calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-check-youtube-income-7.jpg"                      alt="how to check youtube income on mobile phone 6"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?"></a>Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4qA2pGQ5qmw?si=1mAA9WTi2Z5F7n6s&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Post-quality-videos"><a href="#1-Post-quality-videos" class="headerlink" title="1.

From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;</p><p><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mile):</strong> CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.</p><p>Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.</p><p>All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.</p><p>You can also calculate your YouTube channel total earnings by using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tunepocket.com/youtube-money-calculator/" >YouTube calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-check-youtube-income-7.jpg"                      alt="how to check youtube income on mobile phone 6"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?"></a>Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?</h2><h3 id="1-Post-quality-videos-1"><a href="#1-Post-quality-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

If you don’t plan this from the start, then all the effort you put into designing your channel art will be wasted, as it will either not display properly or will just look terrible. YouTube has provided these guidelines for channel art designs:</p><ul><li>The file size must not exceed 6MB</li><li>The image should ideally be 2560 x 1440 pixels</li><li>The minimum image size is 2048 x 1152 pixels</li><li>The maximum width is 2560 x 423 pixels</li></ul><p><strong>The ideal dimensions for different devices are listed below:</strong></p><ul><li>Mobile:1546px * 423px</li><li>Tablet :1855px * 423px</li><li>Desktop:2560px * 423px</li><li>TV:2560px * 1440px</li></ul><p>You see, YouTube channel art 2560*1440 px is ideal for TV devices. If you’re not sure about the width and height of the channel art image, you can download the <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2972003?hl=en" >Channel Art Templates from YouTube Official Site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check.</p><p>Keeping in mind people will access your channel on a variety of screen sizes, you’re going to need to design channel art that fits within these proportions and displays correctly no matter how it’s viewed. Use the ‘safe area’ displayed on YouTube to ensure your logo and branding is correct on every screen size.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nyp7-xVwqHA?si=XCuZbpKLFIdrGQQh&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Part-3-Why-should-you-care-about-channel-art"><a href="#Part-3-Why-should-you-care-about-channel-art" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why should you care about channel art?"></a>Part 3: Why should you care about channel art?</h3><p>If you’re wondering if you should really be bothered about channel art, the answer is you absolutely should. Channel art is all about branding, and in today’s cluttered web world, having a strong, recognizable brand is crucial. Rather than simply having a place to upload some videos, your YouTube channel can become a powerful marketing tool for promoting your brand and values.</p><p>According to research, we are a highly visual species. 65 percent of people learn better visually, and when you’re thinking about retaining information, 90 percent of what we store in our brains is visual information. By presenting your viewers with visual content, you’re helping them take it in, retain it better and remember you for the future.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqeO4ed766s?si=AWtKHxP4hvQRd_lk&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Part-4-Tips-for-Making-Channel-Art"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-for-Making-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips for Making Channel Art"></a>Part 4: Tips for Making Channel Art</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-tips.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43goO8X0iX0?si=48Cqf6td2q_6T6h3&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="1-Tips-for-Making-Thumbnails"><a href="#1-Tips-for-Making-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="1. Tips for Making Thumbnails"></a>1. Tips for Making Thumbnails</h4><p>A thumbnail is an image that represents your video in YouTube’s search results. There are things you can do with your thumbnail that will make it more likely to get clicked on. Always upload your own thumbnail rather than relying on the one YouTube automatically chooses, and make sure the thumbnail you use is related to the content of your video.</p><p>One of the most important things to remember is that thumbnails are small. It is better if there is not a lot going on in them because details will be hard to see. If there is any text in your thumbnail make sure it is huge so that people can still read it once it has been shrunken down.</p><p>If you are making a thumbnail for a vlog entry then choose a shot that has you in it, particularly one where you are not too far away from the camera. It is also a good idea if the thumbnails for your vlog entries all look similar so it is easy for people browsing to recognize which videos are yours.</p><h4 id="2-Tips-for-Making-Watermarks"><a href="#2-Tips-for-Making-Watermarks" class="headerlink" title="2. Tips for Making Watermarks"></a>2. Tips for Making Watermarks</h4><p>Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos. If your watermark is colored, there should not be more than one or two colors. Unlike the full version of your logo, you do not want your watermark to be overly eye-catching.</p><h4 id="3-Tips-for-Making-Icons"><a href="#3-Tips-for-Making-Icons" class="headerlink" title="3.

With some of the easy-to-use, powerful tools that are available out there, you can make some beautiful, professional-looking channel art in no time at all. Here are six of our favorite tools for creating amazing youtube channel art:</p><h4 id="1-Photoshop"><a href="#1-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="1. Photoshop"></a>1. Photoshop</h4><p>Produced by Adobe, Photoshop has been leading the way in professional design software for many years. When it comes to creating logos, banners, editing photos and more, nothing really comes close to the power of this software. While the professional version of Photoshop can set you back several hundreds of dollars, Photoshop Elements is much more affordable at around the $100 mark, and has enough functionality to do most things you’d need for your channel art.</p><p>New from Adobe is Adobe Spark Post, a free-to-use <a class="link"   href="https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker" >web and iOS app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which has been specifically designed to help you create beautiful channel art. Although it can only provide basic channel art without much in the way of editing tools, if you’re new to graphic design and want a free, user-friendly way to create your art, this could be worth considering.</p><h4 id="2-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#2-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-tools-to-create-channel-art.jpg"                      alt="YouTube channel art maker - PixStudio"                ></p><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform provides a wonderful creative design solution for you. Just through drag and drop templates, and then use photos&#x2F;text&#x2F;elements to design. After the simple and fast design, One-Click to download your creations, and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.</p><p>This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p><h4 id="3-Fotor"><a href="#3-Fotor" class="headerlink" title="3. Fotor"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For a good, user-friendly way to create professional-looking YouTube channel art, Fotor is a pretty solid choice. Using a simple drag and drop interface, users can create a unique channel banner using preset designs or even uploading their own artwork.</p><p>The developers of Fotor have built in a bespoke banner maker, preset to the exact size required for YouTube channel art. This makes it easier than ever to ensure you develop excellent channel art which will display correctly on any device. Editing is limited, so advanced designers will probably find it all a bit too simplistic, but for the man on the street, this is a perfect choice.</p><h4 id="4-Canva"><a href="#4-Canva" class="headerlink" title="4. Canva"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Canva really stands out from the competition for the number of customizable design elements present on the website. From shapes to backgrounds, images to text, there are thousands of awesome, professional-looking elements to choose from to create your unique channel art.</p><p>Similar to Fotor, those who know what they’re doing in the design field will find it lacking in functionality, and there’s an irritating glitch where you can’t stretch more than one image to the ends of the canvas. Watch out for premium design elements too, as lots require payment, although usually not more than a dollar or two.</p><h4 id="5-PicMonkey"><a href="#5-PicMonkey" class="headerlink" title="5. PicMonkey"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.picmonkey.com/" >PicMonkey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For a good middle ground between expensive but powerful Photoshop and free but limited options like Canva and Fotor, PicMonkey is a great solution. It has plenty of design functionality, from working with layers to performing tasks like blending, and you can free draw and erase parts of your image too.</p><p>We found PicMonkey capable of pretty much everything you’d need to create a professional YouTube banner, and it’s a fair bit more user friendly than Photoshop too. It’s not free, but at a cost of $7.99 per month, it’s pretty affordable for what you get.</p><h4 id="6-Snappa"><a href="#6-Snappa" class="headerlink" title="6. Snappa"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://snappa.com/" >Snappa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another web-based freemium service, Snappa has the added advantage of coming pre-loaded with all the dimensions of popular social channel’s banners, profile images and more, including YouTube. That means you can work on your channel art directly, seeing clearly which parts will be displayed on what devices.</p><p>The drawback to this particular platform is the sheer volume of stock images already on the site. There are some nice ones, but due to the lack of organization you need to scroll through quite a few mediocre options to find them. There’s also a fairly ungenerous limit on how many items you can create and save without upgrading, but the pro version is fairly affordable at just $10 a month.</p><p>There are many other services out there to help you create your YouTube channel art and what’s best for you will depend on the type of channel art you’re looking to create, as well as your own abilities with graphic design. Try some of the free versions before you jump in and pay for things, as some are actually really rather good.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/May-pLCUkEA?si=PGlcFZAlsp3S3beI&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Part-6-YouTube-Channel-Art-Templates-Free-Download"><a href="#Part-6-YouTube-Channel-Art-Templates-Free-Download" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: YouTube Channel Art Templates Free Download"></a>Part 6: YouTube Channel Art Templates Free Download</h3><p>If you don’t know how to make youtube channel art, don’t be worry, because in the following part, I’ll share with you some free youtube channel art templates.
