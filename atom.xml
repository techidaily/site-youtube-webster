The good news is that a large number of these videos are not optimized in the correct format and taking some extra time to make sure that every video you post is well optimized for YouTube’s search engine can give you an instant advantage.</p><p>Here’s how you can get your YouTube video ranked higher in search results and attract more views in 6 easy steps.</p><ul><li><a href="#one">Step 1: Find Good Keywords for Your YouTube Videos</a></li><li><a href="#two">Step 2: Make Full Use of Your Video’s Tags</a></li><li><a href="#three">Step 3: Post a Transcript in Your Video Description</a></li><li><a href="#four">Step 4: Write Searchable YouTube Video Titles</a></li><li><a href="#five">Step 5: Optimize Your Video Description for YouTube SEO</a></li><li><a href="#six">Step 6: Use Custom Video Thumbnails</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="1-Find-Good-Keywords-for-Your-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#1-Find-Good-Keywords-for-Your-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Find Good Keywords for Your YouTube Videos"></a>1. Find Good Keywords for Your YouTube Videos</h2><p>The keywords that you choose to use with your video will be the greatest factors in determining whether your video will actually be found by viewers searching for content like yours on YouTube. You need to be intelligent and choose strong keywords that are highly related to both your video and your niche on YouTube. Without the use of good keywords, your video will simply become lost in the endless stream of content being uploaded to YouTube, and audiences who might enjoy it will never get a chance to see it.</p><p>Consider doing some keyword research into your video’s subject using the Google Keyword Planner in or a variety of other <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Make sure the most important keywords are in your tags, title, and description.</p><h2 id="2-Make-Full-Use-of-Your-Video’s-Tags"><a href="#2-Make-Full-Use-of-Your-Video’s-Tags" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Full Use of Your Video’s Tags"></a>2. Make Full Use of Your Video’s Tags</h2><p>Tags are essential. A lot of creators either skip tags or only put in 1-5, and their actions will benefit you if you choose to use a lot.</p><p>Loading up your tags with keywords that are relevant to your video and genre will help your video appear in the viewer’s search results, which will earn you a lot more views. When users are looking for specific information, like how to recover lost data, just including things like ‘lost data’, ‘data recovery’, and even the full phrase ‘how to recover lost data’ in your video’s tags will give you a greater chance to actually appear in search engine results.</p><p>Including the maximum amount of tags possible will help to give YouTube the maximum amount of information to use in order to place your video in the results of different searches or to have it come up as ‘related’ to other videos. Users that only post 3 or 4 tags with each video could be missing out on countless amounts of traffic for their content.</p><h2 id="3-Post-a-Transcript-in-Your-Video-Description"><a href="#3-Post-a-Transcript-in-Your-Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="3. Post a Transcript in Your Video Description"></a>3. Post a Transcript in Your Video Description</h2><p>If you have a script or a transcript for your entire video you should consider posting it in the description of your video in order to improve your search engine ranking. This can also help for users that would like to have a written article to accompany your video and for indexing your video in search engine results. There are so many people that don’t make proper use of their video descriptions on YouTube that doing so will give you an advantage.</p><h2 id="4-Write-Searchable-YouTube-Video-Tiles"><a href="#4-Write-Searchable-YouTube-Video-Tiles" class="headerlink" title="4. Write Searchable YouTube Video Tiles"></a>4. Write Searchable YouTube Video Tiles</h2><p>By including your 1 or 2 most important keywords in the title of your video you will help YouTube sort your video into the correct search results. Generally, your most important keywords will be things like the name of the game you’re playing or the brand of makeup you’re reviewing.</p><p>Try to write titles that are searchable and which also get potential viewers excited about your content. Do not try to be mysterious or clickbait-y in your video title. Big channels can be very successful with those strategies because they’re already guaranteed a certain number of views, but this will almost always backfire for small channels.</p><p>Phrases such as ‘review’, ‘how-to’, and ‘tutorial’ get searched for a lot, so always include them in your titles when they apply to your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Optimize-your-Video-Description-for-YouTube-SEO"><a href="#5-Optimize-your-Video-Description-for-YouTube-SEO" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimize your Video Description for YouTube SEO"></a>5. Optimize your Video Description for YouTube SEO</h2><p>Video descriptions should generally include around 4000 characters (about 900 words) in which you describe the content of your YouTube video, include important keywords, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Using up all the space in your description is a good way to ensure you’re getting the maximum search value out of it.</p><p>If you use a lot of products in your videos (i.e. you make cooking videos, so your favorite frying pan is in a lot of shots) then it is a good idea to look into affiliate programs. Amazon has one of the best. If you become an affiliate you can post links to the products you use in your video description and, if a viewer follows one and buys something (even if it’s not the thing you liked to) you’ll earn a commission. This won’t help you with search rankings, but it’s a nice bonus.</p><h2 id="6-Use-Custom-Video-Thumbnails"><a href="#6-Use-Custom-Video-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Custom Video Thumbnails"></a>6. Use Custom Video Thumbnails</h2><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >custom thumbnail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an excellent way to make your videos stand out (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check out these awesome thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). A good thumbnail is its own piece of quality, customized, visual content that has the power to draw in audiences from search engine results. Make sure to take thumbnail-specific photos and perfect those images with text and graphics in Photoshop or a free alternative like Canva.</p><p>Custom thumbnails come with new metadata for your video and they can often be indexed in Google image searches along with the video content that you create. This means that you will have access to a text search via Google (your video title and description), video searches via Google, a video search via YouTube, and an image search via Google too.</p><p>In order to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create a thumbnail that stands out <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and attracts more views, you should first search for your video’s title on YouTube and see what kinds of thumbnails come up. You want your thumbnail to be enough like the results that viewers recognize it as being on the same topic, and different enough that it doesn’t fade into the crowd (a good strategy is to use a splash of color the other creators haven’t included).</p><p>If you are interested in generating more traffic to any YouTube video be sure to follow these 6 steps for how to get your YouTube video seen (and check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4 more here! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-boosting-video-quality-utilizing-youtube-studios-features/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Boosting Video Quality  Utilizing YouTube Studio's Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-expert-conversion-tools-for-video-content/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Expert Conversion Tools for Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-prime-video-entries-the-best-16-to-maximize-viewership/"><u>2024 Approved  Prime Video Entries  The Best 16 to Maximize Viewership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-from-playtime-to-peak-time-top-gaming-women-in-the-digital-space/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Playtime to Peak Time  Top Gaming Women in the Digital Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/inancial-anatomy-of-youtube-shorts-money-splitting-for-2024/"><u>The Financial Anatomy of YouTube Shorts Money Splitting for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-best-3d-software-for-youtube-intro-creators/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Best 3D Software for YouTube Intro Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ring-money-top-stock-focused-yt/"><u>Mastering Money  Top Stock-Focused YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ize-engagement-with-proper-youtube-video-dimensions-for-2024/"><u>Maximize Engagement with Proper YouTube Video Dimensions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice.techidaily.com/new-top-6-mickey-mouse-voice-generators-for-2024/"><u>New Top 6 Mickey Mouse Voice Generators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/life360-circle-everything-you-need-to-know-on-sony-xperia-5-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Life360 Circle Everything You Need to Know On Sony Xperia 5 V | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/channel-identity-visualization-the-ultimate-toolkit-of-10/"><u>Channel Identity Visualization  The Ultimate Toolkit of 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/mastering-your-slide-show-webcam-screen-capture-methods/"><u>Mastering Your Slide Show  Webcam Screen Capture Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/from-recording-to-revelation-a-comprehensive-guide-to-360-videos-on-facebook-for-2024/"><u>From Recording to Revelation  A Comprehensive Guide to 360 Videos on Facebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-complete-guide-to-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-frp-bypass-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Complete Guide to Samsung Galaxy A15 5G FRP Bypass Everything You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-mastering-sound-logging-our-selection-of-11-precision-gadgets/"><u>[New] Mastering Sound Logging  Our Selection of 11 Precision Gadgets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/2024-approved-straightforward-steps-upside-down-video-with-vlc-software/"><u>2024 Approved  Straightforward Steps  Upside-Down Video with VLC Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ative-audio-enhancements-for-youtube-creators/"><u>Innovative Audio Enhancements for YouTube Creators</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Your banner should make viewers feel happy with the choice they’ve already half-made.</p><ol><li><a href="#basics">YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</a></li><li><a href="#resources">Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</a></li><li><a href="#makers">Free Channel Art Makers</a></li><li><a href="#tips">How to Make Good Channel Art</a></li><li><a href="#inspiration">Channel Art Inspiration</a></li></ol><h2 id="YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics"><a href="#YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics"></a><strong>YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</strong></h2><p>YouTube channel art should be 2560 x 1440px.</p><p>As long as you upload an image or background that is that size, viewers looking at your channel on any device will be able to see that you’ve taken the time to personalize your channel page.</p><p>If you want to make a bit more of an impression, you can start thinking about banner dimensions. Depending on what type of screen (laptop, mobile, television) a viewer is visiting your channel on, they will see a different crop of that 2560 x 1440px channel art. That cropped image is your banner.</p><p>Television will display the entire image, but it is significantly smaller on other devices.</p><p>Desktop or laptop computers can show a view as large as 2560 x 423px, or as small as 1546 x 423px.</p><p>Tablets show an area that’s 1855 x 423px.</p><p>Mobile phones show an area that’s 1546 x 423px. This size is also the smallest possible desktop&#x2F;laptop view, and it is considered the ‘safe area.’ Any important text or graphics in your banner should fit within this section, or they could be awkwardly cut off in some views.</p><p>Here’s a visual guide to channel art dimensions:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/channel-art-cheat-sheet.jpg"                      alt="channel-art-cheat-sheet"                ></p><p>Another important detail to consider is the size of your file. YouTube will allow your channel art to have a file size of up to 6MB, but no larger.</p><h2 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of free resources online, which can make the process of designing your channel art simple, including <a href="#templates">templates</a>, <a href="#photos">stock images</a>, <a href="#patterns">backgrounds</a>, and <a href="#fonts">fonts</a>.</p><h4 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to get great channel art might be to find something pre-built you can personalize. There are a few places online you can find something free that will suit both your style and the types of videos you make:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>filmora.wondershare.com</strong></a></p><p>Here on filmora.io, we have a selection of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >50 free channel art templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download. The banners are divided into 10 categories representing both different types of YouTube channels (i.e., gaming and beauty) and different popular styles (i.e., minimalist and galaxy), so there’s something for everybody. When you download the free templates, you can choose between PSD files, so you can customize your banner in Photoshop and PNG files you can use with a free online program like Canva (or even Paint on your computer).</p><p><a href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/"><strong>Visme</strong></a></p><p>On Visme, you’ll find another 50 free YouTube banners with themes like ‘Rock Star,’ ‘Makeup Tutorial,’ and ‘Cooking Lessons.’ The banners all make use of beautiful high-quality photographs (no patterned backgrounds). You can add your own channel name right on Visme and customize your font&#x2F;color.</p><p><a href="http://yourtubetheme.com/channel-art/"><strong>YourTube</strong></a></p><p>There is a massive amount of resources available on YourTube, which you can download for free. The category labeled templates only has 14 options, but there are really hundreds of options for YouTube channel art. ‘Templates’ just means downloads, which include PSD files where you can edit text. Under ‘All YouTube Channel Art,’ there are over 500 options. Some are patterned backgrounds, some are pictures, but all of them were designed to be channel art. It’s easy to look and imagine where your channel’s name will go.</p><p>There are also a lot of <a href="#makers">Channel Art Makers</a>, which include templates!</p><h4 id="Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts"><a href="#Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts"></a><strong>Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts</strong></h4><p>Sometimes all you need to do is add some text to a really great photo or background pattern. You can find awesome-looking and free options for all three of these things and piece together your own unique channel art.</p><p><strong>Free Stock Photos for YouTube Channel Art</strong></p><p>Unlike templates, stock photos will not already be the exact right size for uploading to YouTube. You’ll have to adjust them, but you don’t need expensive software to do this. You can use a banner maker, or just do some trimming in Paint. While you are making adjustments, <a href="#basics">keep the dimensions</a> from the first part of this article in mind, so important details aren’t partially cut off on some devices.</p><p>There are a lot of beautiful photographs available online, and sites like Stocksy are great if you have the budget available to purchase images. If you need free options, then there are lots of those too, but you do sometimes need to be careful that the way you want to use an image is allowed within the license provided by the site or photographer.</p><p>We recommend these two sites for anybody who finds copyright rules confusing because both of these sites allow you to use their photos for free, for any purpose (commercial or personal), without attribution (although they do appreciate attribution).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-unsplash.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-unsplash"                ></p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/"><strong>Unsplash:</strong></a> This site has a huge selection, and more photos are being added all the time. Finding what you want is as easy as typing a keyword (i.e., ‘sunset’) into the search bar on the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-pexels.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-pexels"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/"><strong>Pexels:</strong></a> you can find a wide variety of images on Pexels just by using the search bar on the main page, much like Unsplash. There is actually some overlap in the images available on the two sites, but they also each have photos the other doesn’t, so it’s worth looking at both.</p><h4 id="Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Photographs just don’t suit every type of channel. If you don’t think photos of scenery match the style of your channel, you might want to consider a background pattern. Because patterns repeat, you don’t need to worry much about things being cut off when you upload a pattern as channel art (although you’ll still need to make sure any text you add is in the <a href="#basics">safe area</a>).</p><p>One thing you should watch for when using a background pattern is that text can sometimes be hard to read if it’s sitting on top of a busy pattern. You might want to put a box of solid color between your channel name and the pattern.</p><p>The patterns on the following two sites are free to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library.png"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library"                ></p><p><a href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/"><strong>The Pattern Library:</strong></a> this truly is a library, and all the patterns were submitted by real graphic designers. When you first arrive on the site, all you’ll see is a randomly selected pattern filling your entire screen. Hovering over the designer’s name in the top left will allow you to download it for free.</p><p>Often, the download will not be as large as the image you see on the site. It will only be a few tiles (or just one tile), and you will need to copy&#x2F;paste it a few times to create a background large enough to use as channel art.</p><p>You can use the navigation tools in the top right of the screen to see more patterns. Clicking the icon that looks like a bunch of squares will allow you to see multiple patterns at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.heropatterns.com/"><strong>Hero Patterns:</strong></a> the patterns on this site are editable before you download. You choose a foreground color, a background color, and the opacity of the design in the foreground. This means that you can make the pattern as subtle or vibrant as you want, which is a great thing to have control over when you’re creating channel art.</p><p>When you choose your custom colors and opacity, every pattern preview on the page will update. You can put in the colors you like for your channel first, and then find a pattern that looks good with them.</p><p>The only downside to Hero Patterns is that downloading your pattern is hard. You actually can’t just download it. Instead, the site generates a code you can embed on a website.</p><p>If you don’t have a website, the easiest thing is probably to use the Snipping Tool (included on all PCs since Vista) to save the preview and then just copy&#x2F;paste it as a tile in a program like Paint or Photoshop.</p><h4 id="Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art"><a href="#Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art"></a><strong>Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art</strong></h4><p>Whatever program you use to build your channel art will already have a selection of fonts. Finding the perfect font to use across your channel art, thumbnails, and for any text, you include in your videos isn’t something you need to think about until your channel is large enough that you’re thinking about your ‘brand’. If you feel like you’re at that stage, or want to get a jump start on it, here are a couple of sites where you can find free fonts and install them on your computer.</p><p><a href="https://www.dafont.com/"><strong>DaFont:</strong></a> there are categories on this site like fancy, gothic, and script, and there are even sub-categories like sci-fi and calligraphy. Licensing limits (whether the font is free and whether it is available for commercial use) will be clearly displayed next to every font. When browsing, you can even type your channel name in where it says ‘Preview’ and see what it will look like in all the different fonts.</p><p><a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/"><strong>Font Squirrel:</strong></a> the nice thing about this site is that everything is guaranteed to be free and available for commercial use. If you scroll down a bit on the main page, you’ll see a toolbar to the right of the screen, which will allow you to narrow down the fonts being displayed by selecting tags like grunge, headings, and casual.</p><p>Once you’ve got an image or images, and maybe even a font you want to use in your banner, you can create your channel art in either a software like Photoshop or a free banner maker (anchor) like the ones below.</p><h2 id="Free-Channel-Art-Makers"><a href="#Free-Channel-Art-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Free Channel Art Makers"></a><strong>Free Channel Art Makers</strong></h2><p>You don’t need an expensive program like Adobe Photoshop to make great channel art. There is a lot of photo editing and graphic design programs available for free online, and most of them are a lot easier to use.</p><p>All three of these sites will allow you to build your banner just by dragging images and text to where you want them, and they even provide premade templates (although those might not be free in some cases).</p><p><a href="https://www.canva.com/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></p><p>Canva is probably the most popular site for creating YouTube banners for free, for a good reason. It’s extremely intuitive for beginners who are making their first graphics, and it’s also a capable enough program to satisfy more intermediate-level users. Canva has stock images, banner templates, and other graphics available, but some of them cost $1 to use. You can also upload your own media instead of relying on Canva’s resources.</p><p>To build channel art in Canva, find ‘YouTube Channel Art’ as one of the options, and you’ll be working with a canvas that’s already the right size. You can also choose from a lot of different layout options, which will divide your canvas into different drop zones for images (pictures will be auto-sized to fit the zone).</p><p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Canva is the huge library of stock images, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that you can’t have multiple images stretched to the end of your canvas.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/"><strong>Wondershare PixStudio:</strong></a></p><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p><p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of PixStudio is that it provides a feature to remove the image background, you can use the image more flexibility. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the features will be used after payment of $7.99 per month.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ultimate-guide-to-effective-youtube-banners.jpg"                      alt="Wondershare PixStudio Banner Maker"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.designwizard.com/"><strong>Design Wizard</strong></a></p><p>This is another easy to use image editor with templates and stock images, like Canva. You just select YouTube Cover from the options in the Social Media menu (there are also options for YouTube Thumbnails and Profile Pics).</p><p>In Canva, images you drag into your layout will automatically shift to fit the area you put them into. This doesn’t happen in Design Wizard, which can either slow down or speed up your process, depending on which you prefer.</p><p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Design Wizard is that it provides you with a ‘safe zone box’ so you can see the smallest view of your channel art while you work. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the photos in Design Wizard aren’t free, so you’ll either have to buy them or use your own.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> the safe zone box costs $1, so the price of your download will always look like $1 until you delete it when you’re finished designing. Then your price will drop to $0 if you haven’t used any other paid elements.</p><p><a href="https://www.fotor.com/"><strong>Fotor</strong></a></p><p>Fotor works similarly to the other two programs on this list. Just look for ‘YouTube Channel Art’ in the Header &amp; Cover section and click on it to start designing. It does not have layouts like Canva, but it is also a drag-and-drop program, and it is better than Canva if you like to edit with layers.</p><p>Fotor has more free templates than Canva or Design Wizard, although it does also have some premium options. Creating a paid account will allow you to access premium resources and get rid of ads (costs $39.99 for the year), but if all you want it for is to create channel art, a paid account probably isn’t worth it.</p><p>You can upload your own images to use in Fotor as well.</p><p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of Fotor is that it has a lot of genuinely free channel art templates you can customize, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that it doesn’t have as many stock photos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art"><a href="#How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Good Channel Art"></a><strong>How to Make Good Channel Art</strong></h2><p>Finding an image, cutting it to the right size, and uploading it to YouTube is easy, but how many of your favorite YouTubers use just an image for their channel art? Usually, there’s at least a little text stating the name of the channel.</p><p>In this section, we’ll give you a quick checklist of things to include in your banner (anchor), and some tips on making excellent channel art.</p><h4 id="Channel-Art-Checklist"><a href="#Channel-Art-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Checklist"></a><strong>Channel Art Checklist</strong></h4><p>Here are some things you might want to include in your YouTube banner. Not all of these are right for every type of channel.</p><ol><li>Channel name</li><li>What kinds of videos you make</li><li>Your posting schedule</li><li>Social media handles</li><li>Your face</li><li>A tagline</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-layout.jpg"                      alt="YouTube channel art layout"                ></p><h4 id="Top-5-Tips-for-Making-Great-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Top-5-Tips-for-Making-Great-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Tips for Making Great YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Top 5 Tips for Making Great YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Besides looking good, your channel art can help convince more of your viewers to become subscribers. Here are our top 5 tips for making channel art that looks impressive and supports the growth of your channel.</p><ol><li><a href="#solidbackground">Solid Background Behind Text</a></li><li><a href="#minimaltext">Keep Text to a Minimum</a></li><li><a href="#imagesandcolors">Use Images and Colors That Suit Your Channel</a></li><li><a href="#face">Include Your Face</a></li><li><a href="#reason">Give Viewers a Reason To Subscribe</a></li></ol><p><strong>Solid Background Behind Text</strong></p><p>When viewers look at your channel page, you want your name and any other information your banner conveys to jump out at them. It is hard for text to jump out at anybody when it’s competing with a busy background, especially if some of the colors in the background are similar to the color of the text.</p><p>If possible, you can place your text on the part of your background pattern or image where there isn’t much happening behind it. When that isn’t possible, it doesn’t mean you need to find a new background. Instead, insert a solid-colored shape between the text and your background image. Your text will look great, and you won’t have to compromise on a background you like.</p><p><strong>Keep Text to a Minimum</strong></p><p>There is a lot you might want to say in your banner. You’ll want to tell viewers the name of the channel, what kinds of videos you make, when you upload those different kinds of videos, and maybe even the general philosophy driving your channel (i.e., ‘to spread positivity’). That’s all great, but try to say it fast.</p><p>Realistically, viewers probably won’t read more than one line of text. Writing more than that could also force you to use smaller text that viewers will have trouble reading. Ideally, a viewer should absorb all the information in your banner at a glance without having to make the decision to read it.</p><p>Keep your text to your channel name and one additional line underneath, if you can. Make sure your additional line of text is smaller than your channel name, so they aren’t competing.</p><p><strong>Use Images and Colors that Suit Your Channel</strong></p><p>If you have an upbeat, positive, channel then a black and red banner with skulls on it might not be the best choice to convey that. Similarly, if you have a gaming channel, then a minimalist banner that includes an Instagram-worthy picture of you wearing the latest seasonal styles might send the wrong message. It will make the viewer that sees it think you have a lifestyle channel, and they may click away thinking the Let’s Play they just watched was a one-off.</p><p>Look at the kinds of colors and images other YouTubers in your niche are using for inspiration for what you should do, but also consider the unique message of your channel. If you consider yourself bold, use bolder colors. If your videos have a more relaxed vibe, something softer might make sense.</p><p>Here’s a guide to what people tend to associate with different colors:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-implication.jpg"                      alt="color-implication"                ></p><p><strong>Include Your Face</strong></p><p>This isn’t essential for every type of channel. If you mostly post gaming content or screencast tutorials and you don’t appear much in your actual videos, there’s no need to appear in your banner.</p><p>However, if your channel is primarily about you as a personality, then including your face in your channel art can have a lot of benefits. People are automatically drawn in by eye contact and feel more connected when they can see a face. Besides just looking good, including your face in your banner can help build a relationship with new viewers and make them feel more comfortable subscribing. They’ll know they’re subscribing to a person, not just a channel.</p><p><strong>Give Viewers a Reason to Subscribe</strong></p><p>Someone who has chosen to check out your channel page is already thinking about subscribing, but they didn’t do it from the video page because they want to know a bit more about you. The things they are probably hoping to find out are:</p><ol><li>Do you have more videos like that one they just watched? Will you make more?</li><li>Are you ever going to post again?</li></ol><p>There are a lot of YouTubers that just give up at some point, or who have started a channel but don’t have time to post very often. That you might never post a new video again, or might not post one for so long that the new subscriber forgets who you are, is a real hesitation viewer can have about subscribing.</p><p>Viewers also want to know that when you do post again, the video you post will be something they like. If they liked the video, they found you through because it was funny, but there’s nothing on your channel page that suggests you do comedy videos regularly, then that can make someone think twice. If you subscribe because of a makeup tutorial, but then the creator only posts personal vlogs from then on, it can be disappointing.</p><p>By clearly stating what kinds of videos you make and when you post them in your banner, you are giving viewers a reason to subscribe.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p><em>“Vlogs &amp; Comedy! New videos every Tuesday.”</em></p><p><em>“Two videos every week! Makeup Mondays and Fashion Fridays”</em></p><p>If you can create channel art that has a layout that makes sense and sends a clear message even at a glance, then that will help you look like a more experienced YouTuber.</p><h2 id="Channel-Art-Inspiration"><a href="#Channel-Art-Inspiration" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Inspiration"></a><strong>Channel Art Inspiration</strong></h2><p>Sometimes your niche on YouTube will determine what kinds of channel art you should use. For example, it makes sense for gamers to include game-related graphics in their banners and for travel vloggers to use photos from the destinations they’ve visited.</p><p>However, for lots of YouTube niches, the channel art you make will be built around your personality. How do you know what fits your personality? Here’s some inspiration based on popular trends.</p><p><strong>Minimalism</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-minimalism.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-minimalism"                ></p><p>This is an example of a minimalist YouTube banner. This style typically uses only 2 or 3 colors and features clean lines, simple backgrounds, and not a lot of noise. If you want to project a calm, tidy, balanced vibe on your channel, then you should consider going in a minimalist direction with your banner.</p><p>This example is light and airy, but you can also create a minimalist look using brighter or darker colors. It just depends on your personality.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Themed</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-galaxy-themed.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-galaxy-themed"                ></p><p>Galaxy banners are exactly what they sound like: channel art featuring space scenes or photographs of the night sky. At first glance, you might think they belong with channels that talk about science or sci-fi, and they are great for that, but they’re also a fun choice for comedy, vlogging, or gaming.</p><p>The great thing about the galaxy style is that it’s cool and different, but it doesn’t take over and distract from your message. There is a lot of room for a space scene to be very personalized. The example above is bold and purple. You can find galaxy photos in just about any color, and they can be either bright like this one or quite dark.</p><p><strong>Funky</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-Funky.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-Funky"                ></p><p>There isn’t really one ‘funky’ style. A funky banner is anything that’s just a little off-beat but still makes sense while you’re looking at it. They tend to be bright and cheerful and are perfect for anyone who considers themselves a bit quirky.</p><p>If you’re looking for inspiration for a custom funky banner, go to your closet and find your favorite funny, cute, or ironic t-shirt. There’s probably something in its design you can bring into your channel art.</p><p><strong>Comic</strong></p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-comic.jpg" alt="/text-and-logo-comic"></p><p>A banner featuring an actual comic book character probably belongs to a channel that discusses comics, but the style itself is great for just about anyone.

This open-source suite has a range of advanced functionalities, supporting the entire process of 3D creation, from modeling and rigging to video editing. As a public project that involved a large number of creative professionals during the design stage, Blender is truly a promising alternative to corporate products. This free creative suite is quite versatile and can be used for tasks such as game creation, video editing, post-production effects, and rendering.</p><ul><li>Primarily intended for 3D animation projects</li><li>Allows great creative freedom on a wide range of tasks</li><li>Customizable and user-friendly interface</li></ul><h2 id="3-Wondershare-Filmii"><a href="#3-Wondershare-Filmii" class="headerlink" title="3. Wondershare Filmii"></a>3. Wondershare Filmii</h2><p>Available for: Windowsx</p><p>As one of the most commonly used free video editing software packages, Wondershare Filmii deserves some consideration.

It can be used to cut scenes, adjust color levels, or apply filters and special effects.

This free software has all it takes to produce a stunning-quality video, including ten cinematic filters. It is even possible to start editing the shots on your phone, then easily transfer them to your MacBook laptop to execute more precise operations and tweak the colors.</p><ul><li>Works on all Apple devices, including smartphones and iPods</li><li>Supports 4K high-resolution videos</li><li>Amazing filters for cinematic quality of your videos</li><li>Easy sharing to social networks or directly to YouTube</li></ul><h2 id="6-Lightworks"><a href="#6-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="6.

The timeline is very easy to manage, while users can take advantage of real-time effects and color correction tools to improve the look of the video.

Machete Video Editor Lite"></a>7. Machete Video Editor Lite</h2><p>Available for: Windows</p><p>As a simplified version of a more comprehensive professional solution, Machete Lite has obvious advantages over other free video editing software products.

VSDC Free Video Editor"></a>11. VSDC Free Video Editor</h2><p>Available for: Windows</p><p>Broad compatibility is one of the greatest strengths of this software, as it supports practically any format or codec you can think of. However, it is also notable for non-linear editing capacities, great visual&#x2F;audio effects, and the simple creation of masks. With the help of some color blending and a few filters, VSDC can be used to produce smooth, attention-grabbing YouTube videos, as well as a range of other video materials with absolute ease, even if you are new to filmmaking.</p><ul><li>Non-linear sequencing of shots</li><li>Precise object positioning and&#x2F;or masking</li><li>Simple exporting of finished videos to social networks</li></ul><h2 id="12-WeVideo"><a href="#12-WeVideo" class="headerlink" title="12.

Windows Movie Maker"></a>13. Windows Movie Maker</h2><p>Available for: Windows</p><p>Everyone knows about this editor since it’s been around for a long time. Microsoft stopped releasing new versions, but Windows Movie Maker remains relevant in 2018. It’s definitely not the most advanced product in the market and it is best suited for simple projects and beginner-level users. However, its cutting and editing tools are pretty solid, while transitions, animations, and visual effects are quite simple to pull off.</p><ul><li>Already included on many Windows-based computers</li><li>Sourcing footage from a computer or camera</li><li>Direct sharing to YouTube and other networks</li></ul><h2 id="Are-you-ready-for-something-better"><a href="#Are-you-ready-for-something-better" class="headerlink" title="Are you ready for something better?"></a>Are you ready for something better?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>As you can see, there is no shortage of free video editing software suites. However, free software does tend to be either very limited, or very specifically targeted (i.e. Blender is specifically for animators). Wondershare’s <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Filmora</strong> <strong>Video Editor</strong></a> is a great choice for YouTubers and other video creators who are starting to grow out of programs like Windows Movie maker.

In theory, these recommendations are based on your viewing habits and you’re only directed to videos you’re interested in.</p><p>Except we all know that’s not always what happens.</p><p>YouTube’s recommendations are based on more than just what you’ve watched and searched for, and sometimes even the data on that can get skewed over time. Not all your searches reflect your real tastes, and as your search history builds up the algorithm can start having trouble with all that data.</p><p>Here’s what you can do about it:</p><ol><li><a href="#manage"><strong>Manage Your Watch History</strong></a></li><li><a href="#notinterested"><strong>Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested</strong></a></li><li><a href="#butwhy"><strong>But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Manage-Your-Watch-History"><a href="#Manage-Your-Watch-History" class="headerlink" title="Manage Your Watch History"></a>Manage Your Watch History</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-watch-history.jpg"                      alt="Manage Watch History"                ></p><p>Scroll to the bottom of any page on YouTube and you will see a button marked <strong>History</strong> with an hourglass icon. To access this feature using a mobile device, go to the <strong>Account</strong> tab and tap <strong>History</strong>.</p><p>You will be able to completely clear your watch history, remove specific videos from it, or pause your history while you look at videos you don’t want a record of you visiting. By taking control of your history, you can make sure nothing you looked up on a random whim is reflected in your recommendations.</p><p>If you are being recommended more things you aren’t interested in than things you are, you might want to clear your history completely and start fresh. Maybe your tastes have changed since YouTube started keeping track of them.</p><h2 id="Tell-YouTube-You-Aren’t-Interested"><a href="#Tell-YouTube-You-Aren’t-Interested" class="headerlink" title="Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested"></a>Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tell-youtube-not-interested.jpg"                      alt="Tell YouTube Not Interested"                ></p><p>Based on your watch history, YouTube knows what you like.

Nobody outside of Google knows exactly how the algorithm works, but we do know one of the major factors influencing it is to watch <strong>time</strong>.</p><p>Watch time refers to how a video effects the session time of a viewer. If a video has proven it can keep viewers on YouTube for longer it is more likely to get recommended, even if it isn’t closely related to the interests of individual viewers. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to keep you on the site longer. Part of that is recommending things, surely, you’ll be interested in, and part of that is trying to get you interested in things that’ll keep you around.</p><p>  A video that is simply watched for longer, because it is engaging and can hold viewers’ attention for a long time, will have a high watch time. So will a video that is short, but which leads into a playlist which holds peoples’ attention. If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.</p><p>The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.</p><p> Are you usually happy with YouTube’s recommended videos?</p><h2 id="What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used"><a href="#What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used" class="headerlink" title="What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?"></a>What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-the-key-to-online-success-mastering-backlink-construction/"><u>In 2024, The Key to Online Success  Mastering Backlink Construction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/roducing-teaser-videos-with-a-twist-for-2024/"><u>[New] Producing Teaser Videos with a Twist for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-becoming-a-skin-deep-sage-setting-up-your-beauty-channel/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Becoming a Skin-Deep Sage  Setting Up Your Beauty Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ical-forecast-the-dominant-23-social-themes-for-2024/"><u>Graphical Forecast  The Dominant '23 Social Themes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-pro-gamers-video-toolkit-selection/"><u>[New] In 2024, Pro Gamers' Video Toolkit Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/king-your-online-opportunities-a-complete-guide-to-measuring-views-revenue-and-growth/"><u>Unlocking Your Online Opportunities  A Complete Guide to Measuring Views, Revenue, and Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-elevate-your-video-game-the-best-of-8-mirrorless-cams/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Elevate Your Video Game  The Best of 8 Mirrorless Cams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-mastering-youtube-music-blends/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering YouTube Music Blends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-custom-thumbnail-for-twitter-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Custom Thumbnail for Twitter Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-mirror-screen-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How Samsung Galaxy A15 5G Mirror Screen to PC?

If you are a gamer or creating videos primarily from your desk, this is a perfectly suitable microphone for you to start your YouTube journey with.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The audio quality of this mic can help you get the job done, but it won’t blow you away. The cable is attached to the microphone and is 6.5 feet (2 meters) long, which isn’t a wide range. It’s pretty much restricted to the desk with your computer. This microphone has limitations, and high-achieving YouTubers will certainly grow out of it.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $50"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $50</strong></h2><h4 id="Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99"><a href="#Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99" class="headerlink" title="Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99"></a><strong>Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R" >Purple Panda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lavalier microphone comes with multiple adapters and is compatible with nearly all devices, including smartphone, DSLR, computers, and even GoPro cameras. The only device where you will need an <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35mm-headphone-jack-adapter" >additional adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is if you have an iPhone 7.</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/purple-panda-lavalier-microphone.jpg"                      alt="purple-panda-lavalier-microphone"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> This microphone is a versatile option for YouTubers who create a variety of content. It doesn’t require any battery and is powered by whatever device it is plugged into, which is great for YouTubers with already so many devices to keep charged.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> Much like the BOYA BY-M1, the Purple Panda, as it is clipped onto your lapel or shirt collar, will capture the sound of your clothes brushing against it if too much movement occurs.</p><h4 id="Samson-Go-Mic-Portable-USB-Condenser-Microphone-37-73"><a href="#Samson-Go-Mic-Portable-USB-Condenser-Microphone-37-73" class="headerlink" title="Samson Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone - $37.73"></a><strong>Samson Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone - $37.73</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Mic-Portable-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B001R76D42" >Samson Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> microphone is the kind of mic that can fit in your pocket and be taken with you anywhere.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone.jpg"                      alt="samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> This microphone has both a cardioid and an omnidirectional mode. This means that you can choose to have your microphone focused more on the subject speaking by switching to cardio or switch to Omni-directional to capture audio from the entire surrounding.</p><p>It is designed to be able to clip onto a flat surface such as your computer screen. This allows you to place the microphone on different levels to record.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> Because of its unique design and the portability of the device, it will suffer wear-and-tear faster. Attention to storage is necessary to increase the lifespan of the device.</p><h4 id="XIAOKOA-Mini-Condenser-Microphone-with-Stand-24-99"><a href="#XIAOKOA-Mini-Condenser-Microphone-with-Stand-24-99" class="headerlink" title="XIAOKOA Mini Condenser Microphone with Stand - $24.99"></a><strong>XIAOKOA Mini Condenser Microphone with Stand - $24.99</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Condenser-Microphone-Recording-XIAOKOA/dp/B074GZJ4RP/" >XIAOKOA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> portable mini condenser microphone is compatible with smartphones, computers, and any devices using 3.5mm recording jacks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand.jpg"                      alt="xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> With a cardioid pickup, this condenser microphone will do a fine job picking up vocals. If you are a YouTuber who does a lot of singing videos, this is definitely an affordable microphone to check out.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> This microphone, perhaps primarily designed for karaoke, has an echo feature that, although might create new dimensions to your vocals, may not be desired for your YouTube video. This feature can be problematic, as it could spoil your recording.</p><h4 id="TAKSTAR-SGC-598-26-93"><a href="#TAKSTAR-SGC-598-26-93" class="headerlink" title="TAKSTAR SGC-598 - $26.93"></a><strong>TAKSTAR SGC-598 - $26.93</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I" >TAKSTAR SGC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a condenser microphone, and it can be fixed onto your camera, which simplifies your YouTube setup. This camera can plug directly into your camera, reducing the audio tracks you need to manage when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/takstar-sgc-598.jpg"                      alt="takstar-sgc-598"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> The camera-mounted microphone has a shock-resistant design that reduces noise when the camera is moved. The cardioid microphone will be able to pick up audio in the direction it is pointed in, reducing noise capturing from behind the camera. This is a good microphone for vlogging or interviews.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The TAKSTAR SGC requires one AA battery, so you’ll have to remember to carry a backup every time you film.</p><p>Limited to a vocal subject standing 4-5 feet away, any more and the microphone will be hard-pressed to pick up the audio without capturing a lot of surround audio.</p><p>The design requires it to be mounted to the camera. If you want to separate it from the camera and still have it recorded, a bit of creativity is required to keep it standing.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-100"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-100" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $100"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $100</strong></h2><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="Behringer-C-1U-59-99"><a href="#Behringer-C-1U-59-99" class="headerlink" title="Behringer C-1U - $59.99"></a><strong>Behringer C-1U - $59.99</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-C-1U-BEHRINGER/dp/B001QXCYZY/" >Behringer C-1U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a condenser microphone with a cardioid pickup pattern that connects to your computer via USB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/behringer-c-1u.jpg"                      alt="behringer-c-1u"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> This microphone has a solid metal build and has a good weight. It is quick and easy to set up and is a good microphone for anyone wanting a simple solution for better audio on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> A pop filter is recommended for this microphone as it picks up a lot of popping sounds when the subject speaks.</p><h4 id="Blue-Microphones-Snowball-iCE-64-94"><a href="#Blue-Microphones-Snowball-iCE-64-94" class="headerlink" title="Blue Microphones Snowball iCE - $64.94"></a><strong>Blue Microphones Snowball iCE - $64.94</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-Versatile-Microphone/dp/B01L5U4WBQ" >Blue Microphones Snowball iCE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a cardioid condenser microphone that connects to your computer via USB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/blue-microphones-snowball-ice.jpg"                      alt="blue-microphones-snowball-ice"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> The Snowball iCE is a plug-and-play microphone that is super easy to use and doesn’t require any additional battery. Simply connect it to the computer, and you are ready to record your voice. It captures clear and crisp audio for a single voice or single-person recording.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The range of this microphone is not that great; you’ll have to be close and be speaking directly into the microphone to get the best audio. It is not ideal for recording moving subjects or those who are further than 2-3 feet away.</p><h4 id="Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-57-06"><a href="#Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-57-06" class="headerlink" title="Marantz Professional MPM-1000U - $57.06"></a><strong>Marantz Professional MPM-1000U - $57.06</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/" >Marantz Professional MPM-1000U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a condenser microphone that records in a cardioid polar pattern that connects to your computer via USB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/marantz-professional-mpm-1000u.jpg"                      alt="marantz-professional-mpm-1000u"                ></p><p><strong>Pro</strong>: This budget microphone has excellent all-metal construction. It has a plug-and-play setup and doesn’t require any drivers or installations. It records great instrumentals and would recommend it to those who are recording music for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Con</strong>: May pick up extraneous noises if you are recording vocals while there are movements in your surrounding, but otherwise, this is an excellent microphone in its price range.</p><h2 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>When looking for microphones under $100, the difference in audio quality is not going to be drastic. What you need to consider is how you are going to be using this piece of equipment.</p><p>If your YouTube videos consist of you in a quiet studio environment, I would recommend the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/" >Marantz Professional MPM-1000U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>However, if you will be recording on the go and require your hands to be free in the scene, I recommend getting a lavalier microphone such as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R" >Purple Panda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But, if you are going to be recording other people, in addition to yourself, I’d say go with the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I" >TAKSTAR SGC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it will give you more audio control in busy environments.</p><p>What are you looking for in a budget microphone?

Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.</p><p>When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="1-Be-Authentic"><a href="#1-Be-Authentic" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Authentic"></a><strong>1. Be Authentic</strong></h2><p>People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.</p><p>Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.</p><h2 id="2-Tell-A-Story"><a href="#2-Tell-A-Story" class="headerlink" title="2. Tell A Story"></a><strong>2. Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience"></a><strong>3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience</strong></h2><p>There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html" >surprising, yet inevitable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.</p><p>The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat’s bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.</p><h2 id="4-Be-Inviting"><a href="#4-Be-Inviting" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Inviting"></a><strong>4. Be Inviting</strong></h2><p>A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.</p><p>Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.</p><p>The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Compose-the-Shot"><a href="#5-Compose-the-Shot" class="headerlink" title="5. Compose the Shot"></a><strong>5. Compose the Shot</strong></h2><p>Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.</p><p>In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.</p><p>The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the basics of video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Check out this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q" >Rosanna Pansino <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where she gives a tour of her bedroom.</p><p> The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to. Don’t hesitate to let the viewer know what you want them to see.</p><h2 id="6-Be-Prepared"><a href="#6-Be-Prepared" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Prepared"></a><strong>6. Be Prepared</strong></h2><p>While you can pick up a camera and start vlogging on the fly, being prepared enables you to produce the best video possible. Take a few minutes before you hit record simply to outline the key points you want to talk about and how the video will end, ensuring that after filming you haven’t forgotten a crucial part.</p><p>Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…</p><p>Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.</p><p>Take a look at <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w" >Ashley Nichole <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.</p><h2 id="7-Be-Expressive"><a href="#7-Be-Expressive" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Expressive"></a><strong>7. Be Expressive</strong></h2><p>Remember those teachers that drone on and on, without adding any expression or passion to what they are lecturing? While they might have been perfectly suitable as teachers, they wouldn’t make good vloggers.</p><p>If you speak on camera in a monotone voice, you are not being expressive. Your facial and body language will match your lackluster performance. Even if you are talking about something you are excited about, if your demeanor doesn’t match that, then the video is going to be lifeless. Vlogging is a presentation, a performance. There needs to be energy.</p><p>Consider your audience: they are coming home from school or work, where there were classes and meetings, and the last thing they want to watch is a video of your speaking without energy.</p><p>Want to see a vlogger that is awesome at being expressive on camera? Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg" >Emma Chamberlain <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, if you haven’t already. Every word she says in her video is layered with emotion. We know exactly how she feels.</p><h2 id="8-Stay-Organized"><a href="#8-Stay-Organized" class="headerlink" title="8. Stay Organized"></a><strong>8. Stay Organized</strong></h2><p>The same way you should prepare before filming, it’s also important to be organized comes the editing phase. Editing is arguably the most time-consuming part of the vlogging process, so have a system for categorizing and finding your footages.</p><p>This is especially important when you have multiple video and audio files and if you are capturing footage over a number of days or in different locations.</p><p>Additionally, while filming your vlog, you are going to mess up. It’s also helpful to add a cue after you messed up, this can be a sound cue that causes the levels to spike (clapping or snapping your fingers work) or a video cue such as a dramatic gesture to the camera. When skipping through your footage to find the part where you messed up, later on, it’s easier to have a mark to help you locate it.</p><p>Vlogging is hard, so don’t make more work for yourself. Learn little tricks to make life easier for yourself at every step.</p><p>The more organized you are the more attention you can put into the creative aspect of vlogging, and less time finding a video file or syncing audio to video.</p><p>There you have it, 8 tips to help you vlog like the pros. Anyone can vlog. But only until you point a camera at yourself in public for the first time, do you realize how uncomfortable vlogging can be.</p><p>Even filming yourself in your room with the door closed — and nobody is in the house with you — can be a challenge for beginning vloggers. If you find watching your first few videos to be cringy, don’t be discouraged. There are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >fears of vlogging, but you can overcome them <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Take a look at some of the <a class="link"   href="http://tubularinsights.com/throwback-thursday-first-videos-from-youtubes-top-stars/" >first videos from popular YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you can see that everyone had a starting point.</p><p>Do you have any vlogging tricks of your own?

Along with all this massive inflow, there are scenarios where the video content that you like or wanted to watch gets deleted for any reason. Either the uploading channel deleted the video, or YouTube sometimes deletes videos for violating any of the platform’s rules – showing the dismal message “We’re sorry, this video is no longer available”. You’ll be thinking it is probably impossible to access deleted YouTube videos that you wanted to watch so badly. Though it may be true to some extent, in reality, nothing gets deleted from the internet. To help you watch deleted YouTube videos, we’ll dive into the two most handy methods down below. So, let get started.</p><p>You might be interested in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make a Playlist of Uploaded Videos and Others’ Video on YouTube&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare FilmoraX</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title="["></a>[</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL"><a href="#Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL"></a>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</h2><p>Internet Archive(known as the Wayback Machine) is a website archival system that has been collecting and cataloging websites since 1996. This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video. You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt="Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2. Head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >archive.org website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and paste the YouTube video URL in the search bar and press return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-way-back-machine1.jpg"                      alt="open way back machine"                ></p><p>3. Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites. But sometimes, this method may not work and would require a more sophisticated way to watch deleted YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title="["></a>[</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL"><a href="#Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL"></a>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</h2><p>But what if you don’t have a URL for the deleted YouTube video? The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4. If you know the video was shared by someone on Facebook or any other social media platform, you can change the site URL in the search bar, replacing YouTube with Facebook, for example.</p><p>5. Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.

You can get by for a long time setting your camera up on a stack of books, or an upside-down laundry hamper, but not forever. While these setups are great for a beginner, an intermediate vlogger will start to find them limiting. Even if you are an amazingly creative person who can create any camera setup without a tripod there will come a point where you will decide your creative energy is better spent on your video content.</p><p> This article will explain how to use a tripod and then introduce you to four different types.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Set-a-Tripod-for-Vlogging"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Set-a-Tripod-for-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Set a Tripod for Vlogging"></a>Part 1: How To Set a Tripod for Vlogging</h2><h4 id="1-Setting-Up-Your-Tripod"><a href="#1-Setting-Up-Your-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="1. Setting Up Your Tripod"></a>1. Setting Up Your Tripod</h4><p><strong>Step 1 –</strong> Pull out all three legs of your tripod and make sure it is standing stably. There will be tensioners on the legs which you can release in order to adjust your height. Once your legs are extended to the height you want continue adjusting them until your tripod is level. Some tripods have a built in bubble level, but if yours does not you can use a separate bubble level or make a guestimate.</p><p> Make sure when you are setting up your tripod that you point one of its legs towards your subject. This will give you room to stand behind your camera, in-between the other two legs. If you have one leg pointed directly behind your camera then you may trip over it. Or, you may knock over and damage your camera.</p><p><strong>Step 2 –</strong> On the top of your tripod there will be a plate with a small hole and a screw. Remove this plate using either a clip or lever, depending on your tripod. Once your plate is detached screw it into the bottom of your camera. It should be tight, but not too tight or you risk damaging your camera.</p><p><strong>Step 3 –</strong> Attach your plate, which now has your camera mounted to it, back onto your tripod.</p><p> Your tripod comes with a ‘head’. Your tripod’s head is what your camera is mounted on top of. There are several different types of tripod heads and mounts which are all useful for different things.</p><p> Ball Heads and Pan&#x2F;Tilt Heads are the two most common types of tripod heads. Ball Heads allow you to adjust your camera’s position quite a bit before you start shooting. They are not good for adding in camera movements while you are filming, however, because you need to lock them in place. Pan&#x2F;Tilt heads are great for creating camera movement. Most Pan&#x2F;Tilt heads have a handle which you can use to make a smooth panning motion.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Do-You-Need-a-Tripod-Benefits-of-Using-Tripod"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Do-You-Need-a-Tripod-Benefits-of-Using-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Do You Need a Tripod: Benefits of Using Tripod"></a>Part 2: Why Do You Need a Tripod: Benefits of Using Tripod</h2><p> Why can’t you just hold a camera in your hand while shooting vlog entries for your YouTube channel? Honestly, you can, but the camera may shake a lot and your footage might end up being unusable. Putting a camera on a tripod reduces the probability of camera shake to the minimum and that is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p> A huge amount of vlogs can be described as sit down videos, in which the host of the video sits in front of a camera and talks to the audience. Holding a camera while talking or trying to present a product to the viewers is next to impossible, so in order to avoid having to deal with a camera, you can simply put it on a tripod, find the best angle, and push the record button.</p><p> On the go videos, are recorded at exterior locations, and a lot of YouTubers choose to shoot these types of videos handheld, but this approach makes it difficult to maintain the same shot composition for long. A Monopod, Gorillapod or just a simple selfie stick can make your job much easier because they stabilize the camera. In addition, shooting smooth panning shots without a tripod is as difficult as it sounds.</p><h2 id="Part-3-A-Few-Things-You’ll-Need-to-Consider-Before-You-Buy-a-Tripod"><a href="#Part-3-A-Few-Things-You’ll-Need-to-Consider-Before-You-Buy-a-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: A Few Things You’ll Need to Consider Before You Buy a Tripod"></a>Part 3: A Few Things You’ll Need to Consider Before You Buy a Tripod</h2><p> There are thousands of different tripod models you can use for vlogging, but which model you’re going to choose depends mostly on the type of vlog you want to make. If you are planning on shooting all of your videos in the studio-like conditions, then portability isn’t such an important feature, while quite the opposite is true if you intend on filming all of your footage on outdoor locations.</p><p> However, there are certain traits you have to consider when choosing a tripod you’re going to use while recording your vlog entries.</p><p><strong>Sturdiness:</strong> There is absolutely no point in spending money on a tripod that breaks easily. Although if your plan is to shoot vlogs at home or in a studio, then buying a cheaper plastic tripod isn’t such a bad option, since the clamps and joints won’t have to endure a lot of wear and tear. Consider buying a more durable tripod if you are going to be traveling a lot while working on your vlogs.</p><p><strong>The Type of Camera:</strong> A number of factors can contribute to the weight of a camera, including battery grips or lenses, so before you buy a tripod make sure that it can support the weight of the camera you want to use to record your videos.</p><p><strong>The Maximum Height:</strong> Most vloggers don’t really have to worry about how tall their tripod is, because they are not on their feet in any of the shots featured in the video. Vloggers working on DIY videos, cooking tutorials or any other type of vlog that involves movement and action should pay attention to this trait.</p><p><strong>Photo or Video Tripods:</strong> Do you want to take beautiful panning shots? If the answer is yes then you should get a video tripod that enables you to move the camera smoothly in any direction. Photo tripods are a great option for static shots that don’t involve a lot of camera movement.</p><p> <strong>Mobility:</strong> The heavier a tripod is, the more stability it can provide, but carrying a tripod that weighs over 10 pounds to shoot sports or adventure vlogs can be a tiring endeavor. Although portability is a factor, it shouldn’t prevent you from buying a high-quality tripod that will ensure your footage is perfectly smooth and stable.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Tripods"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Tripods" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Tripods"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Tripods</h2><p><strong>Full-Sized Tripods:</strong> are very sturdy, and as a result can be fairly heavy. Although you can take them a lot of places they are not convenient to carry for extended periods of time. They are the most reliable way to ensure you have absolutely no camera shake.</p><p><strong>Compact Tripods:</strong> appear to be the same size as Full-Sized tripods, but they are actually much lighter. You can get the same height with a Compact Tripod as a Full-Sized tripod and it will be much easier to travel with. However, Compact Tripods are not as stable. If you are shooting for an extended period of time you may need to weigh your Compact Tripod down with sandbags to keep it steady.</p><p><strong>Gorillapods:</strong> have flexible legs which can be wrapped around posts, fences, or anything else you may want to mount your camera on. They are also lightweight enough that you can carry them around while you shoot. If you bend it right you can essentially use your Gorillapod as a heavy-duty selfie-stick for your camera.</p><p><strong>Table-Top Tripods:</strong> are very small and easy to travel with. You can leave one in your camera bag or your glove box. Table-Top Tripods are meant to be set up on top of desks or other stable surfaces and may not be ideal for heavier cameras.</p><h2 id="Part-5-The-5-Best-Tripods-For-YouTube-Vlogging"><a href="#Part-5-The-5-Best-Tripods-For-YouTube-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: The 5 Best Tripods For YouTube Vlogging"></a>Part 5: The 5 Best Tripods For YouTube Vlogging</h2><p> Even if you know everything there is to know about tripods, the selection process can be daunting. That’s why we’ve shortlisted the top 5 tripods on the market, in an effort to make finding the right tripod for your vlog videos as quick an easy as it can possibly be. Let’s have a look.</p><h4 id="1-CamRah-Smartphone-Tripod"><a href="#1-CamRah-Smartphone-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="1. CamRah Smartphone Tripod"></a>1.

You can hardly make a mistake if you choose to buy this tripod because you’ll be able to use it to record vlogs at interior and exterior locations.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Easily adjustable to any surface</li><li>Perfect for high angle shots</li><li>Heavy-duty locks</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Weighs 7.9lbs</li><li>Not the best choice for action and adventure vlogs</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-revolutionize-your-branding-50-free-youtube-banners-inside/"><u>[New] In 2024, Revolutionize Your Branding - 50 Free YouTube Banners Inside</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-elevate-your-metadata-management-unveiling-the-best-7-affordable-online-tags-extractors/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Elevate Your Metadata Management  Unveiling the Best 7 Affordable Online Tags Extractors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/66742832-updated-2024-approved-supercharge-your-media-download-sounds-for-editing/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Supercharge Your Media  Download Sounds for Editing!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-3-techniques-to-retrieve-and-save-youtubes-iconic-images/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  3 Techniques to Retrieve & Save YouTube's Iconic Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-expertly-selected-asmr-tools-for-androidios/"><u>In 2024, Expertly Selected ASMR Tools for Android/iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-crafting-powerful-partnerships-a-guide-to-choosing-youtube-allies/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Crafting Powerful Partnerships  A Guide to Choosing YouTube Allies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-capturing-quality-lens-recommendations-for-content-makers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Capturing Quality  Lens Recommendations for Content Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-top-8-pitfalls-for-novice-youtube-creators/"><u>In 2024, Top 8 Pitfalls for Novice YouTube Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/0-easy-youtube-video-ideas-everyone-can-make-it/"><u>[New] 10 Easy YouTube Video Ideas Everyone Can Make It</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-pinterest-gif/"><u>4 Things You Need to Know About Pinterest GIF</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/top-10-asus-rog-phone-7-android-sim-unlock-apk-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 10 Asus ROG Phone 7 Android SIM Unlock APK</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/uncovering-old-social-media-narratives-on-laptops-and-mobile-devices-for-2024/"><u>Uncovering Old Social Media Narratives on Laptops and Mobile Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/trouble-with-iphone-6s-plus-swipe-up-try-these-11-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Trouble with iPhone 6s Plus Swipe-Up?

No matter how many followers you may currently have, you are an amazing person just as you are with a unique story. Here are ten <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to share your personal story.</p><ul><li><a href="#one">Channel Trailer</a></li><li><a href="#two">My YouTube Story</a></li><li><a href="#three">Draw My Life</a></li><li><a href="#four">Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#five">Never Have I Ever Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#six">Get Ready With me Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#seven">My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story</a></li><li><a href="#eight">Narrated Autobiopic</a></li><li><a href="#nine">25 Facts About Me</a></li><li><a href="#ten">YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar</a></li></ul><h3 id="1-Channel-Trailer"><a href="#1-Channel-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="1.  Channel Trailer"></a>1.  Channel Trailer</h3><p>Before posting any videos on your channel, it can be a great idea to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create a “Channel Trailer” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> summarizing who you are and what your channel is all about.</p><p>YouTuber Shameless Maya does an excellent job of this. She created a visually appealing and engaging 1-2 minute channel trailer that explains exactly what her channel is all about. Feel free to be as creative as you want to be.</p><h3 id="2-My-YouTube-Story"><a href="#2-My-YouTube-Story" class="headerlink" title="2.  My YouTube Story"></a>2.  My YouTube Story</h3><p>On Monday, May 17th, 2010, YouTube celebrated its fifth anniversary. In celebration of hitting their five-year mark, YouTube launched a “My YouTube Story” campaign, which featured fifteen YouTubers sharing how YouTube has changed their lives. Each of these videos would end with “What’s your YouTube story? Tell us by uploading a video.” Ever since that campaign, many YouTubers have shared their YouTube story, including me! After I had been on YouTube for two years, I felt it was time for me to share my own YouTube story with the world. Sharing your story is not only an opportunity for your viewers to get to know you but a way to inspire other creators to start their channels as well. We all have our reasons for why we started, so why not share them?</p><h3 id="3-Draw-My-Life"><a href="#3-Draw-My-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Draw My Life"></a>3.  Draw My Life</h3><p>“Draw My Life” is a popular video where YouTubers share their life stories through a unique series of drawings. Often YouTubers use a white dry erase board and markers so they can erase and redraw the series of their life events. Mr. Kate provides a great example of this as she is a talented artist and DIY’er. The great thing about this is you don’t have to be an artist or a great drawer. It’s a fun way to be creative and tell your story.</p><h3 id="4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A"><a href="#4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="4.  Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A"></a>4.  Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A</h3><p>Who isn’t on Snapchat, Instagram, or both these days? Over the past year, I’ve seen YouTubers get creative by asking their viewers to send snaps asking questions they will answer on a Q &amp; A video on their channel. This video idea is great because it involves live viewer participation and a chance for viewers to be seen or noticed on their favorite Youtuber’s channels. Beauty guru stars Manny MUA and Jeffrey Star did a great example of this as a collaboration.</p><h3 id="5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A"><a href="#5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="5.  Never Have I Ever Q &amp; A"></a>5.  Never Have I Ever Q &amp; A</h3><p>Who hasn’t played the “Never Have I Ever” game?! Playing this game as a Q &amp; A is a great way for viewers to get to know you better with some juicy and shocking details about yourself they otherwise wouldn’t know. It’s also a great way to play and collaborate with another YouTuber. Often, the questions will be split and you have to watch both YouTubers’ videos to find out all the details. Highly popular beauty YouTuber Desi Perkins does a great example of this while playing the game with her sister in law.</p><h3 id="6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A"><a href="#6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="6.  Get Ready With Me Q &amp; A"></a>6.  Get Ready With Me Q &amp; A</h3><p>Get ready with me Q &amp; As are some of my favorite videos to watch because it’s nice to see YouTubers strip-down bare-faced to do their makeup and answer popular questions. It often feels like two old friends sitting down to chat. Jenn, I’m doing a great example of this when she took to twitter asking viewers to ask her questions she would answer on her channel. Not only did she answer the questions but she gave a detailed makeup tutorial and explanation of the products she used as a 2 for 1. Even if your channel has nothing to do with makeup or fashion, some viewers can still be intrigued to learn more about your fashion and makeup style.</p><h3 id="7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story"><a href="#7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story" class="headerlink" title="7.  My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story"></a>7.  My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story</h3><p>Behind all their smiles and outrageous on-camera personas, there are a lot of YouTubers who are dealing with depression and anxiety. Beauty and fashion YouTuber Alyssa Forever not only shared her story on how she dealt with her depression but gave tips and ways to be happier. If you are facing depression, anxiety, or some other mental illness, it can give others hope if you share your story.</p><h3 id="8-Narrated-Autobiopic"><a href="#8-Narrated-Autobiopic" class="headerlink" title="8.  Narrated Autobiopic"></a>8.  Narrated Autobiopic</h3><p>Narrated Autobiopic videos are a great way to share your story or advice in a cinematic way. You can be as creative as you want to be. YouTuber Evelyn From the Internets posted a narrated autobiopic called “For People Who Feel Behind In Life” that comically introduces her story.</p><h3 id="9-25-Facts-About-Me-Tag"><a href="#9-25-Facts-About-Me-Tag" class="headerlink" title="9.  25 Facts About Me Tag"></a>9.  25 Facts About Me Tag</h3><p>This is probably one of the easiest ways to share things about yourself when starting as a YouTuber or even if you’re a veteran. Viewers are always looking to learn more interesting things about you so you are more relatable. I’ve been a fan of Vasseur Beauty for a few years now and was surprised by many of the things she shared about herself.</p><h3 id="10-YouTube-Live-Webinar"><a href="#10-YouTube-Live-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="10.  YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar"></a>10.  YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar</h3><p>YouTube live videos are probably the best ways to interact and share your story with viewers. Viewers can ask questions on the spot. YouTuber Roberto Blake shares great live videos on how to improve your videos and things he’s learned through personal experience.</p><h2 id="Custom-Your-Video-with-Excellent-Video-Editor"><a

Even so, building your channel exclusively around <strong>reaction videos</strong> may prove to be difficult, but this doesn’t mean that you can’t use this type of video to comment on what other YouTubers are saying.</p><p>The process of <strong>making a YouTube reaction video</strong> is not overly technical, although you will have to decide which video editing technique you are going to use to make a reaction video.

Consequently, the selection of videos you can comment on is going to be limited, since it is entirely up to the creator of the video if they are going to give you permission to use their footage in your reaction video.</p><p>You can use the following video editing techniques, once you have access to the video you would like to comment on.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Making-a-reaction-video-with-the-Picture-in-Picture-feature-in-Filmora"><a href="#Method-1-Making-a-reaction-video-with-the-Picture-in-Picture-feature-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Making a reaction video with the Picture-in-Picture feature in Filmora"></a>Method 1: Making a reaction video with the Picture-in-Picture feature in Filmora</h3><p>Video editing software, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, can also be used to create YouTube reaction videos, but you must have all the footage you would like to include in that video before you can start putting it together.</p><p>The first step is to create a new project in Filmora and then import the media assets into the editor. Besides video clips, you can also add music, pictures, or create opening titles and end credits for your reaction video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Place the video you’re reacting to on a video track on the timeline and then add the video of your reaction to the timeline that is directly above the one to which you added the first video clip. Click on the top video in the preview window and use the handles that are positioned around the edges of the video to adjust its size.</p><p>If you would like to change the on-screen position of the overlay clip, you should simply click on it and drag it to the new location within the preview window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-reaction-video-size-position.jpg"                      alt="Create reaction video with Filmora Picture in Picture feature"                ></p><p>Filmora offers more than sixty motion effects, hundreds of transitions, and visual effects that can make your reaction video more visually appealing to the audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compositing-video-9.jpg"                      alt="Filmora  compositing with Blending modes"                ></p><p>Moreover, Filmora video editing software offers a variety of blending modes, and it lets you control the opacity of the overlay video so that you can make it more transparent. Whether or not you are going to use these options depends on the footage you’re working with and the demands of a particular project.</p><p><strong>Pros of using the Picture in Picture feature to make reaction videos in Filmora:</strong> You can place and adjust the videos with more customizable options.

The only way to avoid being absolutely sure that your reaction video isn’t violating the law is to contact the video creator and ask for permission to use their intellectual property. However, most YouTubers are reluctant to let others download and edit their videos unless they already have a large fan base.</p><p>In case you’re granted permission to comment on a video, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you don’t get the permission you’re all the money the reaction video generates will go to the copyright owner or you will be forced to delete the video from your channel. There are still a few things you can do, even if you don’t get permission to use the video you would like to comment on.</p><p>Muting the video’s audio or altering its pitch will make it more difficult for YouTube’s bots to detect copyright infringement, although this method may not always work. In addition, you can play a video for up to thirty seconds, then comment on that segment, and then play another segment of that video.</p><p>There is no way of saying whether any of these editing tricks are going to help you avoid a copyright claim, and you should only use them if you have no other option.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Anyone can master the technical aspects of making a reaction video, but the topics you react to need to be related to the general topic your channel covers. What’s more, the idea of your reaction video has to be relevant for your audience if you want to attract their attention.

People will subscribe when they feel invested in you as a person, and that happens when they feel like you are being sincere. You do not need to share all of your innermost secrets on your vlog, but you should let your viewers feel like they know you.</p><h3 id="2-Don’t-forget-to-add-a-call-to-action"><a href="#2-Don’t-forget-to-add-a-call-to-action" class="headerlink" title="2.

At the end of all your videos, ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel and like your social media page.</p><p>Don’t forget to explain the benefits of subscribing to them, such as to benefit from your informative tips and gain a deeper insight into your projects. If you have any interesting videos in the pipeline, let them know about them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-video.JPG"                      alt="call to action"                ></p><h3 id="3-Listen-To-Your-Subscribers"><a href="#3-Listen-To-Your-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="3.

If people feel comfortable enough to leave you suggestions and requests then that is even better. It means that you have succeeded in making them feel like they are part of your community.</p><p>If you get a video request, try to do it. People like to feel that you are open to trying the things they want to see. However, there are also times when you should just ignore requests and suggestions. If the majority of your subscribers enjoy your jokes and you get one comment telling you to stop trying to be funny then it is fairly obvious that that ‘suggestion’ does not really reflect the wishes of your community.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subscriber02.JPG"                      alt="get subscriber"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-your-title"><a href="#4-Optimize-your-title" class="headerlink" title="4.

A site called Gleam can oversee a contest for you. It’s up to you to choose how you want the contest to work, and you can gain an edge over your competitors by getting people to leave comments, follow you on Instagram, subscribe to your channel and more.</p><p>You will be provided with a landing page for promoting your channel, and you can share this in a variety of places, including on your Facebook, Twitter and blog. The best way to heighten your chances of success is to have a clear goal in mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-contest.JPG"                      alt="video0 contest"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-a-trailer"><a href="#3-Make-a-trailer" class="headerlink" title="3.

Your trailer gives you a valuable opportunity to quickly explain what your channel is all about and what the benefits of following you are.</p><p>Don’t waffle on – try to get your clip down to 90 seconds maximum. Include clips from your videos and don’t forget to add a strong call to action at the end. The more effort you put into your videos, the bigger the rewards are likely to become. And here are some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best trailer makers that you can use on both Windows and Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-killer-youtube-channel-trailer.jpg"                      alt="trailer"                ></p><h3 id="4-Make-a-Schedule-and-Stick-To-It"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule-and-Stick-To-It" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It"></a>4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It</h3><p>You want to vlog at least once a week, and making a schedule will help you keep on top of that. It will also give your subscribers a chance to anticipate your videos and get excited. They are more likely to watch an update they have been expecting than one that was not already on their minds.</p><p>Sticking to your schedule is a good wait to build up credibility with your audience, but late or skipped updates will cause you to lose that credibility. If you do not post for a month then people who already subscribed to you might still ignore your update because it has been too long and they forgot about you.</p><h3 id="5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers"><a href="#5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers"></a>5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers</h3><p>Collaboration videos are always big hits. When you collaborate with another vlogger you are essentially introducing each other to your subscribers. This is a great way to grow your community quickly: by connecting it to another community.</p><p>Collaborations work best when the other vlogger is located close enough to you that you can actually meet up, but you can do distance collaborations too. When you collaborate you and the other vlogger should have close to the same number of subscribers, so the video will benefit you both equally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cooperation.JPG"                      alt="cooperation"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]"></a>Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]</h2><p>There are lots of ways to get free YouTube subscribers. This proven method involves networking with other creators! Making your presence felt on YouTube is an important part of creating your network of subscribers that watch, share and talk about your videos. Interaction with your subscribers, reaching new audiences every day, and a plethora of other factors influence how well your YouTube channel is doing.</p><p>In this part, we will show you how you can build your own network of loyal YouTube supporters and prove that you don’t need the services of paid providers who promise better reach for your channel.</p><h3 id="1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche"><a href="#1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche" class="headerlink" title="1. Find YouTubers in your niche"></a>1. Find YouTubers in your niche</h3><p>The first step to building an enviable army of YouTube subscribers starts with the realization that you are not alone. Regardless of the niche, your videos are covering, there are probably thousands of people who are just starting out or that have as many subscribers as your YouTube channel. Focus on finding them. You may even want to make a list.</p><h3 id="2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like"><a href="#2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like" class="headerlink" title="2.

By subscribing to YouTube channels in your genre you appreciate, you will make yourself known to the channel’s owner, and there is a chance they will check out and subscribe to your channel.</p><h3 id="3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day"><a href="#3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day" class="headerlink" title="3.

Spend time watching videos each day</h3><p>Knowledge is power and, if you want to attract real people to your channel, you should learn how to use your knowledge to your advantage. By paying attention to other new videos in your genre you’ll gain insight into what is going over well with audiences like yours, and what isn’t.</p><p>Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.</p><h3 id="4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return"><a href="#4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return" class="headerlink" title="4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return"></a>4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return</h3><p>Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else’s positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.</p><p>If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don’t be the person who’s always saying ‘Subscribe to my channel’. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.</p><h3 id="5-Reach-out-on-social-media"><a href="#5-Reach-out-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="5. Reach out on social media"></a>5. Reach out on social media</h3><p>YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.</p><p>Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.</p><h3 id="6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again"><a href="#6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again" class="headerlink" title="6. Do it all again. And again. And again"></a>6. Do it all again. And again. And again</h3><p>You aren’t going to see great results overnight. You have to spend time almost every day repeating the steps we just described. This might seem intimidating, but as time passes it will become routine.</p><p>When you build your presence on YouTube in this way, other creators and their subscribers will naturally start becoming your subscribers. What’s your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe. If you stop making videos because you did not get any subscribers or comments on your first few then chances are there were people who were paying attention who may have subscribed if you had kept at it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Stock footage doesn’t replace your own recorded videos, though, it just supplements them by adding a bit of variety. Stock video footage is especially useful for things like intros and transitions.</p><p>Here are 4 YouTube channels where you can find free stock footage. To learn how to download videos directly from YouTube, check out the tutorial <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Royalty-free Video Footage:</strong></p><p><a href="#freestockfootage">1.

Free Stock Footage Archive</h2><p>This channel has a massive library of free stock footage, which is updated semi-regularly. They have backgrounds, ‘glitch’ effects (which look really cool when combined with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s green screen tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), and more classic stock footage options like street scenes and forests. There’s a particularly interesting playlist of black and white videos, which could be useful if you’re trying to make a darker or creepier project.</p><p>Besides video footage, this archive also has some sound effects.</p><h2 id="2-Beachfront-B-Roll-Free-Stock-Footage"><a href="#2-Beachfront-B-Roll-Free-Stock-Footage" class="headerlink" title="**2. Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage"></a>**2. Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage</h2><p>This stock footage channel has lots of nature scenes and wildlife. There’s some urban and technology stuff too, but their nature stuff is especially great. It’s easy to find what you’re looking for on Beachfront B-Roll because they have themed playlists for different seasons, as well as for things like ‘sky’ or ‘water’.</p><p>On their <strong><a class="link"   href="http://www.beachfrontbroll.com/" >website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, you can find even more content and multiple download options.</p><h2 id="3-HDStockFootageFree"><a href="#3-HDStockFootageFree" class="headerlink" title="**3. HDStockFootageFree"></a>**3. HDStockFootageFree</h2><p>This channel doesn’t have a large variety of different kinds of footage – all of it is pretty industrial. There’s footage of trains, trucks, trash, and people working. It’s the kind of stuff that you might not find on other stock footage channels because it’s not necessarily pretty.</p><h2 id="4-NatureClip-Free-Stock-Footage"><a href="#4-NatureClip-Free-Stock-Footage" class="headerlink" title="**4. NatureClip: Free Stock Footage"></a>**4. NatureClip: Free Stock Footage</h2><p>The name of this channel pretty much says it all. They’ve got tons of great nature videos, including scenery, animals, flowers, and views. It’s not all everyday nature either, they’ve got cool macro shots of bugs, and a lot of more exotic animals. One particularly noteworthy playlist is devoted entirely to slow-motion clips.</p><p>If you know of anywhere else, people can get free stock footage, say so in the comments!</p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.

Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.</p><h4 id="1-SpinXO"><a href="#1-SpinXO" class="headerlink" title="1. SpinXO"></a>1. SpinXO</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> - Lots of options</p><p> - Checks availability</p><p>This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.</p><p>Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><p>Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.</p><p>One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><h4 id="2-Name-Generator"><a href="#2-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="2. Name Generator"></a>2. Name Generator</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can be hilarious</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Names tend to be a bit long</p><p>This is a fairly limited generator. You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example-generated.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.</p><h4 id="3-Username-Generator"><a href="#3-Username-Generator" class="headerlink" title="3. Username Generator"></a>3. Username Generator</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can generate a huge number of names at once</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  You only input one word</p><p>For this name generator, you type in one important word and choose how many results you want to see. You can see up to 300 at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator"                ></p><p>The generator will take your keyword and add endings (and occasional beginnings) to it. Some endings are words, and some are just suffixes. Here’s what I got:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator-generated.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator Sample"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Come-Up-With-a-Good-YouTube-Name-–-3-Easy-Steps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Come-Up-With-a-Good-YouTube-Name-–-3-Easy-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name – 3 Easy Steps"></a>Part 2: How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name – 3 Easy Steps</h2><p>The name of your YouTube channel needs to accomplish two things:</p><ol><li>Tell viewers what your channel is about</li><li>Stick in viewer’s heads by being catchy and unique</li></ol><p>Here’s how you can brainstorm the perfect name for your channel!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Gather-up-relevant-words"><a href="#Step-1-Gather-up-relevant-words" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Gather up relevant words"></a><strong>Step 1: Gather up relevant words</strong></h4><p>Open up a journal (or a word document) and start writing down words that relate to you and your channel.</p><p>You may want to make one list of ‘you’ words (personality traits, nicknames, titles, etc.) and another of words related to your channel’s category (i.e. gaming, makeup, or baking).</p><h4 id="Step-2-Combinations"><a href="#Step-2-Combinations" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Combinations"></a><strong>Step 2: Combinations</strong></h4><p>Start combining your ‘you’ words with your category words to see what sounds good. You may want to use one of the name generators above (anchor) for this part.</p><p>Try to keep your name fairly short (3 words or less) so it’s easier for people to remember. Don’t include numbers if you can avoid it.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Say-it-out-loud"><a href="#Step-3-Say-it-out-loud" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Say it out loud"></a><strong>Step 3: Say it out loud</strong></h4><p>Once you have a shortlist of potential names, read them aloud to yourself to make sure they sound good. Ideally, you want to get that ‘oh, that has a nice ring to it!’ feeling.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Your-YouTube-Name"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Your-YouTube-Name" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Your YouTube Name"></a>Part 3: How to Change Your YouTube Name</h2><p>In the early days of YouTube, you couldn’t change your name, but now you can!</p><ol><li>Click on your account icon in the top right corner of YouTube and choose settings.</li><li>Click <strong>Edit on Google</strong>.</li><li>Update your name and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Requesting-a-Custom-URL-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-4-Requesting-a-Custom-URL-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Requesting a Custom URL for YouTube"></a>Part 4: Requesting a Custom URL for YouTube</h2><p>Here are several <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of YouTube channel URL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, wouldn’t it be nice if, instead of a string of numbers and letters, your channel URL included your name?
