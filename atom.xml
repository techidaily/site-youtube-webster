More than 5 billion videos are watched every single minute on YouTube. And the ever-growing user base has propelled YouTube to the status of 2nd most popular social media platform in the world, and the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >second most visited website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after Google in 2021.</p><p>YouTube marketing is great for both businesses and individuals who want to make careers out of YouTube. Many businesses make use of YouTube ads to get their products to their customers and it’s really effective. However, you can make more organic traffic using YouTube video marketing. With a successful YouTube video marketing strategy, you can generate leads without any ad investments.</p><p>And in this guide, we will discuss some YouTube video marketing tips that will help you get more subscribers and build your brand outreach.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal"><a href="#Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal"></a><strong>Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal</strong></h2><p>A roadmap is basically a level by level approach to your vision. Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p><p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Un9G2_OdSRI?si=vAcGbco8DuWt4ypP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels. There are some important tests that you can do to understand the genre that you are targeting.</p><h3 id="a-Test-video-duration"><a href="#a-Test-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="a. Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p><p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sk53d1bBhY?si=yaTeDogLb3D4dYu1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p><p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format. For example:</p><p>And many videos that aren’t specifically cooking at all!</p><p>And it is evident that these new formats have also become crowd favorites. Now do all their videos hit the 1 million mark? No, that just shows they are constantly testing out the waters go ahead with what works and discard what doesn’t!</p><h3 id="c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts"><a href="#c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts" class="headerlink" title="c. Try Giveaways and gifts"></a>c. Try Giveaways and gifts</h3><p>You can boost the viewership and subscriber count for your channel by setting up occasional giveaways or gifts to the viewers. Make sure that you set the winning criteria to have the viewers subscribe to the channel.</p><p>For example, let’s take another popular YouTube channel Unbox Therapy. On Jun 27, 2018, the channel did an announcement that they were giving 106 OnePlus 6 smartphones!</p><p>And the result of the announcement was evident in the subscribers count.</p><p>From June 23rd to June 27th, 2018, Unbox therapy had gained 12,583 subscribers. However, from the announcement date that is June 27th to June 30th, 2018, the channel saw an increase of a whopping <a class="link"   href="https://www.trackalytics.com/youtube/user/unboxtherapy/" >52,173 subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>! Till date, the video has over 14 million views</p><p>We do not advise you to try this out when you are just starting your YouTube career. Only venture out to such investments when you are stable when it comes to earnings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8U3ooyFiAB4?si=yXPQrDhMBEJwN2EZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback"><a href="#Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback"></a><strong>Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback</strong></h2><p>All your videos must be created with the audience in mind. However, sometimes what you may think would work might not fit well with the audience. Hence, it is imperative that you understand their likes and dislikes.</p><p>And the best way to improve your videos is to take suggestions from the audience themselves. You can ask them specific questions on how to improve your videos or what they want to see in your future creations. Take notes on what they have to offer and start building your content taking in those suggestions.</p><p>There is also another facet to incorporating audience feedback as it projects your YouTube channel to be responsive to the audience, something that is vital to building a strong and loyal viewer base on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources"><a href="#Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources" class="headerlink" title="Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources"></a><strong>Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources</strong></h2><p>YouTube has made it easier for you to track the sources from which your videos are getting the views. Sign in to YouTube Studio Beta and the click Reach from the Analytics menu provided on the left panel. Now click on Traffic source types.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Analytics"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxv4NM-89CU?si=Uj5rOkhrwZ_6QIuW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>In this window, you can see the different sources that led viewers to your video. Generally, it can be a mix of websites, YouTube recommendation’s, YouTube search, etc. Metrics like Watch Time gives you an idea of how long viewers watch your videos and Audience Retention shows how consistent they are at watching them. These are just two of the many metrics you can use to your advantage.</p><p>Analyzing YouTube videos will help you structure your future videos in a way that it is more susceptible to being clicked.</p><h2 id="Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos"><a href="#Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos"></a><strong>Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos</strong></h2><p>You must have an eye on the metrics that your videos garner over the days. While the number of views, likes, and dislikes are great indicators in determining the popularity of the videos, but there are many more factors at play.</p><p>Your video ranking is important as it determines the position of your videos when a keyword is typed into the search box. The ranks are calculated by the YouTube algorithm, but you have a certain degree of power in raising the ranks by leveraging the following parameters of the video;</p><p><strong><em>Thumbnail:</em></strong> The first thing that the viewer is going it see when they are browsing through a list of videos is the thumbnail. Make sure that it is attractive and stands out!</p><p><strong><em>Title:</em></strong> The next element that gets the most attention from both the user and the YouTube algorithm is the title. Ensure that the main keyword you are targeting is included in the title.</p><p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> This is where you can play a lot with keywords, both short and long tail.

These are short, vertical videos that are 60 seconds long. Originally a way of YouTube attempting to compete with TikTok, Shorts have become a household name. However, are YouTube shorts monetized? Can you get paid for YouTube shorts? The increasing interest in monetizing Shorts has inspired many creators working on their video creation. This article answers the question of <strong>can YouTube Shorts be monetized</strong> and explains how the revenue-sharing model works.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts Editor</strong> A cross-platform helps creators edit the vertical videos quickly and easily!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOyLy8DeizY?si=GkAmK0hChZw6_2tW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E1ax-vnGdeo?si=bgTkOhOEwDTlRQE3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Leave Room"></a>1. Leave Room</h4><p>If you know you are going to add text to your video then make sure you leave room for it in your frame. Consider standing off to one side instead of directly in front of your camera. You do not want to have to choose between not using text, making your text really small, or placing it over your face.</p><p>While planning out your frame and leaving room for your text, consider what color you are going to make the words and whether it will stand out and look good against your background.</p><h4 id="2-Bigger-is-Better"><a href="#2-Bigger-is-Better" class="headerlink" title="2. Bigger is Better"></a>2. Bigger is Better</h4><p>People should be able to read your text without putting in any extra effort, such as straining their eyes to make out small words. If it takes effort to read your text then a lot of people will just ignore it. Your text should be big enough that somebody watching your video on their smartphone screen – where everything is shrunk down – can read it easily.</p><p>It is easier to make your text larger when you stick to titles, keywords, and short sentences.</p><h4 id="3-Do-Not-Overuse"><a href="#3-Do-Not-Overuse" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Not Overuse"></a>3. Do Not Overuse</h4><p>Text is a great tool for making something stand out. However, if you try to use text to emphasize too much of what you say it will lose its effect. Text does not stand out anymore once viewers get too used to seeing it. Too much text can even get annoying and cause people to click away from your videos.</p><p>Try to use text to emphasize only the most important things you say.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-extensive-review-capturing-every-angle-with-gear-360/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Extensive Review Capturing Every Angle with Gear 360</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/lub-chronicles-expertly-picked-dj-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Club Chronicles Expertly Picked DJ Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-demystifying-recmeisters-advanced-screen-capture-technology-for-2024/"><u>[New] Demystifying Recmeister's Advanced Screen Capture Technology for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ath-to-youtube-prosperity-unlocking-monetization-with-500plus-views-for-2024/"><u>[New] Path to YouTube Prosperity Unlocking Monetization with 500+ Views for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-the-art-of-authenticity-financial-fruits-in-filmmaking/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Art of Authenticity Financial Fruits in Filmmaking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-the-complete-guide-to-editing-youtube-on-the-go-with-sony-vegas/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Complete Guide to Editing YouTube on the Go With Sony Vegas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/ai60-120/"><u>高效AI填充软件：实现每秒60-120帧稳定流畅视频</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-creating-engaging-youtube-content-a-step-by-step-approach/"><u>In 2024, Creating Engaging YouTube Content A Step-by-Step Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-hassle-free-ways-to-remove-frp-lock-on-samsung-galaxy-a14-5gwithwithout-a-pc-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Samsung Galaxy A14 5Gwith/without a PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/eipad-top-10-free-youtube-video-editing-apps-for-2024/"><u>IPhone/iPad Top 10 Free YouTube Video Editing Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/perfect-crossfading-techniques-using-audacity-for-2024/"><u>Perfect Crossfading Techniques Using Audacity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/supercharge-your-screens-with-video-enhancer-v22-for-2024/"><u>Supercharge Your Screens with Video Enhancer (V2.2) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/top-10-ferramentas-essenciais-para-aprimorar-sua-producao-de-videos-em-2024/"><u>Top 10 Ferramentas Essenciais Para Aprimorar Sua Produção De Vídeos Em 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-baldurs-gate-overcoming-pc-game-crashes/"><u>Troubleshooting Baldur's Gate Ⅲ: Overcoming PC Game Crashes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ate-guide-to-purchasing-asmr-microphones-for-2024/"><u>Ultimate Guide to Purchasing ASMR Microphones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-brilliant.techidaily.com/uma-aula-completa-sobre-clareamento-de-video-as-6-melhores-ferramentas-mobile-and-desktop/"><u>Uma Aula Completa Sobre Clareamento De Vídeo - As 6 Melhores Ferramentas Mobile and Desktop</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

That’s why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera’s 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There’s very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800</em> <em>- High video bit rates</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Expensive</em> <em>- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs</em> |<br>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                >        | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 is a great entry-level vlogging camera that delivers great power at a low price.

The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn’t provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D’s 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself.

It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DxUX4R6Cf7c?si=prHevNQJivSkIfUt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;

Do a Skit"></a>1. Do a Skit</h4><p>YouTube is the perfect medium for short, generally between one and ten minutes long comedy sketches. The majority of the audience on YouTube isn’t patient enough to sit through a half-hour show, no matter how funny it is (at least not until you have a large fan base).</p><p>Your skit can be about literally anything, as long as it’s short and effective. Having your own unique sense of humor is a crucial factor in ensuring the success of the sketches you post online.</p><h4 id="2-Start-a-Funny-Series"><a href="#2-Start-a-Funny-Series" class="headerlink" title="2. Start a Funny Series"></a>2. Start a Funny Series</h4><p>Try producing a pilot episode of a comedy series for your YouTube channel. Don’t worry about the budget too much because if your ideas are good even a DIY approach will be enough.</p><p>Producing a funny series requires dedication and commitment to that goal, so don’t let yourself be discouraged easily.</p><h4 id="3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos"><a href="#3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos"></a>3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos</h4><p>Posting cute videos on your YouTube channel will certainly help you get attention online. The Internet loves videos of adorable babies, cats, dogs and other charming animals. Including these types of videos on your channel can be a good way to boost your subscriber count.</p><p>It is important to note that your content must be unique. Re-posting funny animal videos you find online won’t get you far and will make it impossible to monetize your channel.</p><h4 id="4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits"><a href="#4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits" class="headerlink" title="4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits"></a>4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits</h4><p>The term machinima means creating a cinematic production by re-using material from video games. Gameplay skits and machinima videos are a great way of reaching millions of gaming fans who enjoy good comedy videos.</p><p>The gaming industry is on the rise, and the audience that wants to watch video game-related content is growing every day. However, these types of videos require an in-depth knowledge of the gaming world, and you really have to know the games you draw from in order to make this idea work.</p><h4 id="5-Parody-Video"><a href="#5-Parody-Video" class="headerlink" title="5. Parody Video"></a>5. Parody Video</h4><p>A well done, poignant parody never fails to make people laugh. Pop culture provides an endless source of TV shows, movies, and songs that can be used for your parody videos. When pop stars release big new music videos, they always get parodied by someone on YouTube within the first few days in order to capitalize on the trend while it’s fresh.</p><p>Parody videos will provide you with an opportunity to showcase your skills and enable you to show the world that you are a talented, relevant comedian.</p><h4 id="6-Bloopers"><a href="#6-Bloopers" class="headerlink" title="6. Bloopers"></a>6. Bloopers</h4><p>We all make mistakes. Blooper videos enable us to at least laugh at them. Experienced YouTubers know how easy it is to flub a take, but it takes a brave creator to make an entire video from the shots they messed up.</p><h4 id="7-Lip-Sync-Video"><a href="#7-Lip-Sync-Video" class="headerlink" title="7. Lip-Sync Video"></a>7. Lip-Sync Video</h4><p>Have you ever imagined what it’s like to be a pop star?

You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes.

TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.</p><p>You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense.

Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.</p><h5 id="3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators"><a href="#3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators" class="headerlink" title="3) Subscribe directly to creators"></a>3) Subscribe directly to creators</h5><p>You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.</p><h5 id="4-Privacy"><a href="#4-Privacy" class="headerlink" title="4) Privacy"></a>4) Privacy</h5><p>Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”.

Also, you can set timers to help with the filming process among other functionalities.</p><h3 id="Difference"><a href="#Difference" class="headerlink" title="- Difference"></a>- Difference</h3><h5 id="1-Instant-messaging-app"><a href="#1-Instant-messaging-app" class="headerlink" title="1) Instant messaging app"></a>1) Instant messaging app</h5><p>Generally, YouTube is not a traditional social media platform. Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.</p><h5 id="2-In-dependability"><a href="#2-In-dependability" class="headerlink" title="2) In dependability"></a>2) In dependability</h5><p>TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.</p><h5 id="3-Interface"><a href="#3-Interface" class="headerlink" title="3) Interface"></a>3) Interface</h5><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.</p><h3 id="What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need"><a href="#What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need" class="headerlink" title="- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need"></a>- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need</h3><p>Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.</p><p>TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&amp;A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.</p><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen.

Yes, Shorts has some upper hand over TikTok like the ability to edit your videos after being published, a dislike button, and a scheduling tool that lets you schedule when your video goes live. TikTok is still above the cut being that it has been here long before Shorts. More so, it offers advanced editing features for quality video output. Above all, it works independently, a feature that most users adore as compared to the encasing of Shorts within YouTube.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Social media platform is a solace to many users.

Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jf0JvOqiAXc?si=kHEHQGC_PhBv4xij" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-make-quality-videos-for-the-apps-you-choose-3"><a href="#How-to-make-quality-videos-for-the-apps-you-choose-3" class="headerlink" title="How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?"></a>How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?</h2><p>Even though <strong>TikTok and YouTube Shorts</strong> both let you edit your videos, you can stile up your game with other editing apps like Filmora.

Yes, Shorts has some upper hand over TikTok like the ability to edit your videos after being published, a dislike button, and a scheduling tool that lets you schedule when your video goes live. TikTok is still above the cut being that it has been here long before Shorts. More so, it offers advanced editing features for quality video output. Above all, it works independently, a feature that most users adore as compared to the encasing of Shorts within YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-navigating-the-seo-maze-a-guide-to-youtube-keywords/"><u>[New] Navigating the SEO Maze A Guide to YouTube Keywords</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-epic-moments-in-gameplay-with-casters-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Epic Moments in Gameplay with Casters for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-getting-the-most-out-of-your-youtube-videos-thumbnails-extraction/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Getting the Most Out of Your Youtube Videos Thumbnails Extraction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-comprehensive-budget-strategies-for-podcasters/"><u>2024 Approved Comprehensive Budget Strategies for Podcasters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/create-stunning-animations-on-the-go-top-free-3d-apps-for-mobile-for-2024/"><u>Create Stunning Animations On-the-Go Top Free 3D Apps for Mobile for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-lab.techidaily.com/efficient-email-solutions-streamline-your-communication-with-modern-mail-systems/"><u>Efficient Email Solutions - Streamline Your Communication with Modern Mail Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/freeze-action-with-iphone-mastery-of-motion-blur-techniques/"><u>Freeze Action with iPhone Mastery of Motion-Blur Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/hidden-glances-instagram-story-viewing-without-revealing-personal-details-pc-android-iphone-for-2024/"><u>Hidden Glances Instagram Story Viewing without Revealing Personal Details [PC, Android, iPhone] for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-from-interest-to-action-formulating-video-topics-with-google-trends/"><u>In 2024, From Interest to Action Formulating Video Topics with Google Trends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/mlining-your-video-creation-into-profit-youtube-edition-for-2024/"><u>Streamlining Your Video Creation Into Profit - Youtube Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/upgrade-your-images-seamlessly-convert-arw-to-tiff-using-our-no-cost-online-tool-by-movavi/"><u>Upgrade Your Images Seamlessly: Convert ARW to TIFF Using Our No-Cost Online Tool by Movavi</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.</p><p>Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn’t require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.</p><hr><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 03:</strong> For creating a perfect thumbnail, select “Drone Free Camera” mode from the camera mode located on the bottom right corner of the screen. It will allow us to change the angle the way we want. Choose an angle of your choice and take the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 04:</strong> Open Filmora X, make sure to select the 16:9 screen ratio. Import the screenshot using the import button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step4.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 05:</strong> Drag and drop the screenshot into the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step5.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 06:</strong> Now, let’s separate the background and character. Go to the Effects, then AI Portrait, select Human Segmentation, and drop it into the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step6.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 07:</strong> Filmora will ask you to purchase it, but you can now hit “Try it” to use it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step7.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 08:</strong> It will remove the background of the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step8.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 09:</strong> To add a background, go to the media and navigate to “Sample Color.” Drag a color of your choice and drop it below the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step9.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> To add titles in the Thumbnail, go to the Titles tab. Here you can find several categories of titles. Find your preferred title and drop it above all the layers. You can choose titles, lower thirds, and other texts depending upon your need and requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step10.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step10"                ></p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> We can make this Fortnite Thumbnail look more attractive by adding elements such as stickers and icons. Filmora contains a wide range of stickers. To access them, navigate to the Elements tab. Here you can find so many categories of elements. Choose any elements according to your need and drop them in the timeline above all other layers. If you cannot find a suitable sticker, you can download one from the internet and use it by importing it into Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step11.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Once you are satisfied with the final results, you can take the screenshot of the Thumbnail using the Snapshot icon located below the preview panel. It will create a screenshot in the media panel of Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step12.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step12"                ></p><p><strong>Step 13:</strong> To access the directory where this screenshot is saved, right-click on the screenshot and click on “Reveal in Explorer.” It will open the folder that contains all the screenshots you take through Filmora. Your Fortnite Thumbnail is ready to be used on your Youtube videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step13.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step13"                ></p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>With Filmora, there are no limits.

For the latter scenario, the processes explained above are likely to come in handy in order to <strong>play YouTube in background</strong> so the users can take full advantage of their iPhone or Android smartphone in case they only want to listen to the audio, and are not interested in watching the video while streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-dive-into-audacity-simple-steps-to-record-on-mac-devices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Dive Into Audacity Simple Steps to Record on Mac Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-converting-spotify-playlist-selections-for-youtube-music-service/"><u>[New] In 2024, Converting Spotify Playlist Selections for YouTube Music Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-tactics-for-transforming-youtube-list-layouts/"><u>[New] In 2024, Tactics for Transforming YouTube List Layouts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/eading-luminaries-of-livestreaming-success/"><u>[New] Leading Luminaries of Livestreaming Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-unlock-your-videos-potential-with-these-youtube-seo-insights/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unlock Your Videos' Potential with These YouTube SEO Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-deciphering-youtubes-new-earning-standards/"><u>[Updated] Deciphering YouTube's New Earning Standards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-crafting-a-cash-cascade-on-youtube-strategies-beyond-the-ad-model/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Crafting a Cash Cascade on YouTube Strategies Beyond the Ad Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-demystifying-income-flow-to-creators-within-the-short-video-model/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Demystifying Income Flow to Creators Within the Short Video Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-key-players-in-asmr-youtube-world-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Key Players in ASMR YouTube World for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-aspect-ratios-for-stellar-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>2024 Approved Aspect Ratios for Stellar Youtube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-navigating-youtubes-rules-the-safe-way/"><u>2024 Approved Navigating YouTube's Rules The Safe Way</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transforming-mundane-titles-into-visual-marvels-with-ae/"><u>2024 Approved Transforming Mundane Titles Into Visual Marvels with AE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/atomseo/products/"><u>Atomseo's Products</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/boost-your-sites-analytics-capabilities-using-cookiebot-technology/"><u>Boost Your Site's Analytics Capabilities Using Cookiebot Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/discovering-mobile-game-trade-offs/"><u>Discovering Mobile Game Trade-Offs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-code-commanders-elite-females-on-yt/"><u>In 2024, Code Commanders Elite Females on YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-digital-dome-streamlining-your-song-posts-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, Digital Dome Streamlining Your Song Posts on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/recover-excel-2007-files-from-virus-infected-pen-drives-for-free-by-stellar-guide/"><u>Recover Excel 2007 Files from Virus-Infected Pen Drives for Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/up-to-date-driver-downloads-for-hp-officejet-pro-model-number-optimized-for-windows-pcs/"><u>Up-to-Date Driver Downloads for HP OfficeJet Pro ([Model Number]), Optimized for Windows PCs</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This might be needed if you have uploaded content quite some time ago and it is already outdated. Or, if you have too many videos on your channel and you need to clear up those who aren’t that interesting.</p><p> The fact of the matter is that it’s quite easy to remove YouTube videos. The first thing that you would need to do is going ahead and hop on the website and log into your account. Afterwards, you need to go to the “My Channel” option and click on the “Video Manager”.</p><p> Upon doing this, a new page is going to pop up, and you are going to see a list of all the videos that you’ve uploaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-youtube-video-basic-description-3.jpg"                      alt="Video list"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FWCFI3f_cs?si=Kt2Onr_E4c616tbH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> There are little tick boxes on the left side which you can click in order to mark. Mark the videos that you want to edit and click on the “Actions” button on top. There is going to be a drop-down menu, and you can click on the delete option to remove the video permanently. Furthermore, you can also hide the video if you don’t want to delete it but only to hide it away from your subscribers. In order to do so, you should simply click on the Private or Unlisted button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/how-to-remove-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="remove youtube videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPAKth3O_5c?si=3YDfzJAZMDp1gFRz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> That’s pretty much it – there’s nothing further to it, and the entire thing is rather comprehensive and easy to carry out, which makes it convenient to go through.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBWcw6rXIdg?si=Tlue44bW-bPA4tH9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels"></a>Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels</h2><p> Now that we’ve covered how to remove videos from your own channel, it’s time to dig a little bit deeper. There are certain instances in which you might want to remove YouTube videos from other channels as well. The reasons for this are usually rather personal. For instance – someone has uploaded a video including you or something yours without your consent, and this harms your reputation. Furthermore, it may display sensitive information that you don’t want to reveal to anyone else – the reasons are rather different, but they are related to your own individual privacy which is an important legal right.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Blur Faces in YouTube Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The first thing you can do is contact the person who uploaded the video and kindly asks him to remove it using the procedure that we described above. This is going to be the best choice because it’s going to achieve the result quickly and without any hassle. However, in certain cases, the person might not be active, or he might disagree with you and keep the video posted. If that’s the case, you have one option which is likely to be the best alternative.</p><p> You need to report the video as an inappropriate and flag it with the remark that it’s invading your privacy. This is going to lead you to the page of the YouTube Safety Center. You will have to explain the issue in details in a six-step wizard which extensively asks you about how the video is invasive to your privacy rights. The process is quite comprehensive, and it’s easy to go through. However, you will have to wait for the YouTube support team to assess it and make the decision for the removal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-youtube-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="remove other&#39;s youtube videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n4cc4BSqJls?si=Hkd9vwQDqeCGN7XG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The truth is that being able to remove YouTube videos is something important that you should be able to do. It’s going to ensure that your channel is perfectly updated, aligned and structured while at the same time making sure that everything is in line with your privacy. YouTube is a powerful website, and you need to be able to stay in control in order to be protected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_dOmuXhsV6Y?si=aT6vgPbDx4ajjvdr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-economical-mic-options-for-youtube-vloggers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Economical Mic Options for YouTube Vloggers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-top-techniques-for-outstanding-gopro-vlogs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Top Techniques for Outstanding GoPro Vlogs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-mcb-template-pack-download-now-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] MCB Template Pack Download Now for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-photoshop-color-adjustments-for-beginners/"><u>[Updated] Photoshop Color Adjustments for Beginners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-sky-high-broadcasting-your-first-steps-in-youtube-live-via-obs/"><u>[Updated] Sky-High Broadcasting Your First Steps in Youtube Live via OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-understanding-the-impact-of-aurora-hdr-on-photography/"><u>[Updated] Understanding the Impact of Aurora HDR on Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-mac-masterclass-designing-eye-catching-yt-thumbnails/"><u>2024 Approved Mac Masterclass Designing Eye-Catching YT Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/addressing-connection-dropouts-with-steam-remote/"><u>Addressing Connection Dropouts with Steam Remote</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/advanced-methods-for-capturing-system-sounds-on-pcs-for-2024/"><u>Advanced Methods for Capturing System Sounds on PCs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/into-design-get-a-complimentary-set-of-50-banner-pieces-for-2024/"><u>Dive Into Design Get a Complimentary Set of 50 Banner Pieces for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-best-apps-for-screen-mirroring-motorola-edge-40-neo-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 8 Best Apps for Screen Mirroring Motorola Edge 40 Neo PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-apps-from-oneplus-ace-2v-to-another-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Apps from OnePlus Ace 2V to Another | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/quick-subscribe-worthwhile-for-youtubers-in-2024/"><u>Is a Quick Subscribe Worthwhile for YouTubers, In 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Because of its huge community, the videos of Youtube are shared on all platforms throughout the internet. If you are the one who often shares Youtube links with others then you must know how important it is to keep the links as short as possible. There are so many reasons for avoiding long links while sharing Youtube links with others. Whether it’s a blog, social media platform, or a chat, keeping the Youtube link while sharing it can positively impact the viewer. Several Youtube link shorteners can help you shorten the links and make them worthy of sharing. In this article, we will list down Top 5 Youtube link shorteners to help you choose the best. But before moving towards link shorteners, let’s discuss the benefit of using Youtube link shorteners.</p><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlVkEwpjKKo?si=hXi-mchMaJvbnIzM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-should-we-use-Youtube-Link-Shorteners"><a href="#Why-should-we-use-Youtube-Link-Shorteners" class="headerlink" title="Why should we use Youtube Link Shorteners?"></a>Why should we use Youtube Link Shorteners?</h2><p>One of the vital reasons to use Youtube Link Shortener is to increase the click-throughs and shares. Short links are more prone to getting clicks and shares because they look simple and professional as compare to long and stuffy links. If we compare both the links, the short version, and the long version, we will clearly see the difference. The short links look more beautiful and attractive as compare to the long ones.

That’s pretty common.</p><p>If you have a DSLR then you can set it down on any stable surface while filming yourself, but your phone can’t stand up by itself. It needs something or someone to hold it. Do you just accept that and shoot everything as a selfie?</p><p>No. No, you don’t, because there are common household items that can help you out of this problem. For this DIY tripod, you need either <strong>2 binder clips</strong> or <strong>2 ‘claw clips’</strong> (also called ‘hair jaws’).</p><p>Hold your phone in landscape mode (horizontally, so it’s long rather than tall) and attach clips to the bottom corners. If you are worried about scratching your screen, fold up some paper to place between your clip and your phone.</p><p>Here it is with binder clips:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/binder-clips.jpg"                      alt="binder clips"                ></p><p>And here it is with hair clips:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hair-clips.jpg"                      alt="hair clips"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ipTu54inBo?si=gRegjvtVq5gm_PHo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now you can set your smartphone upon any stable surface, like a table or a stack of books.</p><p> <em>Here are some more cool ideas!</em></p><h3 id="DIY-adjustable-tripod-using-books-and-a-towel"><a href="#DIY-adjustable-tripod-using-books-and-a-towel" class="headerlink" title="DIY adjustable tripod using books and a towel"></a><strong>DIY adjustable tripod using books and a towel</strong></h3><p>You’ve probably heard a million times that you can stabilize your camera by sitting it down on any stable surface – on your desk, on a stack of books, up in a tree, etc. This is very true!</p><p>But if you can use any stable surface, why do people buy tripods?</p><p>Because it isn’t convenient to rearrange your furniture whenever you want to make a video, and also because tripods are adjustable. You can change their height, you can use them to pan or tilt, and it’s pretty easy to move them a bit forwards or backward while you’re setting up your shot.</p><p>To get similar functions from the ‘any stable surface’ solution you can use a <strong>table</strong>, a <strong>stack of books</strong>, and a <strong>towel</strong>.</p><ol><li>Set up the area where you’re going to sit while you’re filming on one end of the table.</li><li>Put the towel down over the approximate spot you want your camera to be.</li><li>Stack your books on top of the towel.</li><li>Put your camera on top of the books.</li></ol><p>Now if your camera isn’t up high enough, or is too high, you can adjust it just by adding or taking away books. If you want to move it closer or farther away from you, just pull the towel forwards or backward.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6xXIR_Uh1A?si=TMXzklPEY50MUM05" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="DIY-gripping-‘Gorillapod’-using-wire-and-tape"><a href="#DIY-gripping-‘Gorillapod’-using-wire-and-tape" class="headerlink" title="DIY gripping ‘Gorillapod’ using wire and tape"></a><strong>DIY gripping ‘Gorillapod’ using wire and tape</strong></h3><p>Gorillapod’s are cool because you can use them like normal tripods, carry them around like selfie sticks, or attach them to things like fences and posts. Here’s how you can make something similar using <strong>wire</strong>, <strong>electrical tape</strong> or <strong>duct tape</strong>, and a <strong>1&#x2F;4 bolt</strong>.</p><p>Your wire should be fairly stiff and you’ll need three pieces the same length, which should be at least 10 inches. Old clothes hangers work well. This needs to be something strong enough to support the weight of your camera, but soft enough that it’s not impossible for you to bend.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wire-and-type.jpg"                      alt="wire and type"                ></p><p><em>All of your supplies plus the finished product.</em></p><p><strong>Readying your legs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Bend 2 inches at one end of each wire into a ‘U’ shape. You will probably need pliers for this.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Pick up one of your pieces of wire and wrap one end with electrical tape. Go around 5-10 times (to prevent it from coming undone at the end) and then, without cutting your tape, start moving up and wrapping the rest of your wire. Stop before your ‘U’ section.</p><p>Repeat this with the other two wires.</p><p> <strong>Attaching your legs</strong></p><p><em><strong>Step 1:</strong></em> Place the ‘U’ section of a leg against your bolt. The bolt’s threading should be pointing away from the leg. Now, use your tape to attach them. Wind it around 2 or 3 times, then repeat the process with both of the other legs individually.</p><p><em><strong>Step 2:</strong></em> After all the legs are attached, wrap some more tape around all 3 as tightly as you can.</p><p> Your camera will mount onto the bolt! You’ll be able to use this as a normal table-top tripod or use the flexible legs to grab onto different things like a Gorillapod. <em>Read more at</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-Tripod/"><em>Instructables</em>.</a></p><p><em>Note: make sure the bolt is a fit for your camera before you get too far into this process.</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-full-screen-excellence-in-ppro-video-editing/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Full Screen Excellence in PPro Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-sharpen-your-videography-skills-converting-standard-definition-to-hdr-excellence/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Sharpen Your Videography Skills Converting Standard Definition to HDR Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/dding-audio-descriptions-to-videos-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Adding Audio Descriptions to Videos on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/levate-your-content-with-these-20-pro-video-shortcuts-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevate Your Content With These 20 Pro Video Shortcuts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/rom-humble-beginnings-jake-paul-on-youtube-triumph-for-2024/"><u>[New] From Humble Beginnings Jake Paul on YouTube Triumph for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-evaluating-the-top-video-streaming-apps-for-phones/"><u>[New] In 2024, Evaluating the Top Video Streaming Apps for Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-achieve-unstoppable-viral-traction-with-these-fb-tricks-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Achieve Unstoppable Viral Traction with These FB Tricks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-cutting-edge-drone-graphics-first-20-free-luts-on-dji-drones-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Cutting Edge Drone Graphics First 20 Free LUTS on DJI Drones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-shattering-standards-an-in-depth-look-at-the-eizo-coloredge-monitor-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Shattering Standards – An In-Depth Look at the EIZO ColorEdge Monitor for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-the-affordable-art-of-youtube-introsends/"><u>2024 Approved The Affordable Art of YouTube Intros/Ends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-extraordinary.techidaily.com/como-hacer-un-usb-de-rescate-para-windows-7-guia-completa/"><u>Cómo Hacer Un USB De Rescate Para Windows 7 - Guía Completa</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-11-best-location-changers-for-oneplus-nord-ce-3-lite-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 11 Best Location Changers for OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-made-easy-the-best-10-apps-for-unlocking-your-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Made Easy The Best 10 Apps for Unlocking Your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/newbies-guide-top-10-sms-chamber-secrets/"><u>Newbie's Guide: Top 10 SMS Chamber Secrets</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Great thumbnail image quality and size"></a>1. Great thumbnail image quality and size</h4><p>The thumbnail image quality should be good (HD&#x2F;UHD). It should be bright. No matter what the device (a large TV) the viewers are using, care must be taken to avoid getting blurry thumbnails. The quality and the correct size of the thumbnail will create a positive image of the video in the user’s mind even before viewing the video. The video must be viewed from a variety of devices to test if the quality differs in different devices. Here are some specs for a perfect thumbnail</p><ul><li>The image formats should be in GIF, JPG PNG OR BMP</li><li>The maximum size of the image must be 1280*720 px</li><li>The minimum size 640*360 px</li><li>The aspect ratio 16:9</li><li>The maximum file size 2MB</li></ul><h4 id="2-Show-a-person-in-the-Thumbnail-image"><a href="#2-Show-a-person-in-the-Thumbnail-image" class="headerlink" title="2. Show a person in the Thumbnail image"></a>2. Show a person in the Thumbnail image</h4><p>A human face will get you closer to your audience. Our brain is wired in a way that a human face will draw its attention more than anything. So the users will naturally would an image with a human delivering the content rather than a robot or just a video of nonliving things. People tend to find a connection with the characters displayed on the thumbnail and hence prompting them to click on the video.</p><h4 id="3-Use-descriptive-text-in-your-thumbnail-with-branding-elements"><a href="#3-Use-descriptive-text-in-your-thumbnail-with-branding-elements" class="headerlink" title="3. Use descriptive text in your thumbnail with branding elements"></a>3. Use descriptive text in your thumbnail with branding elements</h4><p>It is not completely possible to deliver a message through a picture and hence try to use descriptive texts. The texts should be clear enough and must be phrased in a manner that increases the curiosity or appeals to the emotions of the viewers. People tend to click a video just because of curiosity, wanting to know what the content is about. The type of font, color, and size also plays an important role in catching the attention of the audience.</p><h4 id="4-Make-Color-Contrast-between-the-text-and-background"><a href="#4-Make-Color-Contrast-between-the-text-and-background" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Color Contrast between the text and background"></a>4. Make Color Contrast between the text and background</h4><p> Complementary colors will make your thumbnail stand out to some extent. Combining a yellow background with a purple foreground or green with red will make it easier to draw the attention of the browsers. Also, the use of analogous colors in the thumbnail makes it more attractive and pleasing to the eye.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-hue7.gif"                      alt="color hue"                ></p><p>Image resource: Pinterest</p><p>Analogous colors are the colors that appear next to each other on a color wheel</p><h4 id="5-Consistency"><a href="#5-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="5. Consistency"></a>5. Consistency</h4><p>Consistency is something most of the people prefer and makes a thing more attractive. A thumbnail video with consistent text font, color tuning, visual effect, etc. will catch the eye of the users as it will stand apart in the whole webpage. Consistency adds to the standards of a video and will make people feel that this video is productive or from an authentic source</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdlXe5RELW0?si=Iz1H1QnLQVw-Eu3e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Create-Your-Own-YouTube-Thumbnail-with-Filmora-for-Free"><a href="#Create-Your-Own-YouTube-Thumbnail-with-Filmora-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Create Your Own YouTube Thumbnail with Filmora for Free"></a>Create Your Own YouTube Thumbnail with Filmora for Free</h3><p>Now that we have learned about how to download YouTube thumbnail for free and the rules you should follows, you may want to create a thumbnail.
