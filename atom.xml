DSLR cameras require enough space inside for an angled mirror to flip up out of the way.</p><p>If your video shooting style is more on-the-go, like that of a daily vlogger or travel vlogger, the smaller size and lighter weight of a mirrorless camera may be more suitable for you.</p><h4 id="Previewing-Images"><a href="#Previewing-Images" class="headerlink" title="Previewing Images"></a>Previewing Images</h4><p>When you’re using a DSLR camera, your optical viewfinder will show you exactly what your camera sees as opposed to a digital preview of what your image sensor picks up. No matter how bright or dark your scene actually is, through the optical viewfinder, you’ll be able to clearly see what your camera sees with the power of your eye.</p><p>Mirrorless cameras, on the other hand, display on your camera’s screen or electronic viewfinder a digital preview of what your camera is looking at. You will notice a lag, especially in low light, between actions that are taking place in front of the camera and the same actions being displayed in your live preview.</p><h4 id="Lenses-and-Accessories"><a href="#Lenses-and-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Lenses and Accessories"></a>Lenses and Accessories</h4><p>Having been around much longer, there are plenty more options for lenses and accessories when it comes to shooting with DSLR cameras. You can choose from all kinds of different quality levels and price ranges.</p><h4 id="Video-Resolution"><a href="#Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Video Resolution"></a>Video Resolution</h4><p>4K video recording is more readily available in mirrorless cameras than DSLR cameras. At a much more affordable budget, you can get your hands on a 4K mirrorless camera. If you want to shoot 4K video on a DSLR camera, though, you will have to pay for some of the most expensive DSLR cameras on the market.</p><h4 id="Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Image Stabilization"></a>Image Stabilization</h4><p>Up until quite recently, you needed to get the right lens with built-in optical image stabilization if you wanted to shoot stabilized photos and videos with an interchangeable lens camera. Image stabilization had not been readily available in the bodies of these cameras.</p><p>In recent years, however, mirrorless cameras have been much more active in their development of camera bodies equipped with shifting image sensors. Your shots can be even more stabilized when the optical image stabilization of your lens is combined with your camera’s in-body sensor-shift image stabilization.</p><h4 id="Battery-Life"><a href="#Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life"></a>Battery Life</h4><p>When it comes to shooting video, DSLR cameras and mirrorless cameras consume about the same amount of power. It’s still safe to say, though, that DSLR cameras, for the most part, have better battery life than mirrorless cameras because their bigger batteries are packed with more power.</p><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?</h2><p>In my opinion, when it comes to filming a video, mirrorless cameras are the way to go. In such a short time, mirrorless cameras have made huge leaps in their capabilities. It won’t be long before the ultimate vlogging camera comes out on the mirrorless market.</p><p>In the end, if you need to edit videos futhermore, try Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

In our guide, you will find an answer to this, along with related queries like how YouTube highlighted comment works, the removal process, its benefits, and more.</p><p>If you own a YouTube channel or are starting one, even you can do this. Without further ado, let’s jump straight into the core of YouTube’s highlighted comments. We’ve categorized this article into a total of 8 parts for simple and better understanding.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Does Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Does Highlighted Comments Look Like on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make Comment Highlighted?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Highlighted Comments URL?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment</a></li><li><a href="#part8">Part 8: Benefits of Highlighted Comments</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?"></a>Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</h2><p>Before you get on with highlighting your comments, you must understand what it means exactly. You may follow comments on the videos posted by several YouTubers, but the highlighted ones are always making it to the top of the list.</p><p>Having said that, neither the content creator nor users or moderators choose to highlight YouTube comments to begin with. They are no rocket science, but only a tad bit more than what you know as a bookmarking feature.</p><p>Think of highlighted comments as a “tag”. You might notice this in the form of a ‘new activity YouTube notification’ link you receive on your registered email. Only you can see this tag when you click the notification and arrive at Youtube.com to either view or reply to a comment.</p><p>Highlighting comments (HC’s) are an automatic feature generated by YouTube. It draws the YouTuber’s &amp; viewer’s attention to relevant activities. Don’t fail to notice that the highlight disappears once you are done interacting in the tagged comment thread. However, they are reloadable by tapping the comment timestamp.</p><p>For instance, you may want to check the following links. The 2 URLs lead you to the same video, but only one of them shows a highlighted comment.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Notice the name “lc” in the first URL- that stands for linked comment. YouTube might include this additional parameter. If a reply comment (HR) gets highlighted, the parent comment gets raised to the top.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAnyQ0uj9Yg?si=Es4_ulcdM_-LuDcq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?"></a>Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?</h2><p>YouTube has been working on improving the navigation of the comment section for videos, and highlighted comments are one of them. These comments appear even above the pinned comments on a video. The label of a highlighted comment is displayed above the commentator’s name in a light grey shade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=lhdUUVYMVQjzHXBh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>YouTube labels comment replies as well and call it “Highlighted Reply.” You can see this tag above the replier’s name in the same color tone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-reply.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Reply"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQn0MYjIfyI?si=rIdjT-qMRpjpJXXa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?"></a>Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?</h2><p>Now, making YouTube highlight your comment on a popular video is nothing less than an art. YouTube doesn’t make it easy for you. The advantage of getting your comment highlighted on YouTube is limitless.</p><p>Thus, anybody who wants to get their YouTube comment an HC tag has to follow a few simple steps, which we will discuss below in another section. Finding the correct or relevant video content that can benefit your channel from such a comment is an excellent place to start.</p><p>For example, if you are a YouTuber who deals in tech information, you need to look for a popular video or channel with a similar genre, in this case, technical knowledge. The more popular the channel is, the more is the chance of a viewer checking the comments on its videos. You will only benefit if you’re comment is highlighted on pages of Youtuber’s who are huge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAzTErKy6h8?si=vi5z3M9_7fW6qiAJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>The ways to acquire the URL or link for a highlighted comment are different for both parties- viewer and host.</p><p>Suppose you are a viewer who is going through the comments section of a video. If you want to get the highlighted URL for the comment, simply click on the timestamp (e.g., 2 weeks ago) beside the commentator’s username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>On the other hand, for a YouTuber, getting access to the comment URL is relatively straightforward. The host will get a notification on his or her registered email-id when a viewer publishes a comment on their posted video. You will find the link to the highlighted comment in the notification</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Replying to “highlighted comments” on your YouTube channel is pretty easy since this feature was developed, keeping the user’s convenience in mind. If you want to follow up or reply to such comments, you can do so from your email or YouTube Dashboard.</p><p>If you click the notification bell icon, whenever a viewer drops a new comment on one of your videos, YouTube will send you a notification via email. On opening the email, you will find a clickable “Reply” option. Or else, if you follow the comment section in the YouTube Dashboard, you can directly view or reply to highlighted comments from here as well.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why a highlighted comment always shows at the top of the comment list? Both the above options will lead you to the comment thread on YouTube. To help you find the new activity easily, it appears with the highlight tag on it. The purpose is to remind you that you are here for that specific comment.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Can you, as a video maker, remove highlighted comments on YouTube? The direct answer to this would be a ‘No.’ It is because based on how you have opened the specific video, YouTube does it automatically.</p><p>Alternatively, you can try out a few temporary solutions.</p><ol><li>You can edit the particular URL of the video where the highlighted tag is showing. Remove the red part of the URL (example given below) starting with “&amp;”:</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> After removing the above parameter, reload the original video link (below):</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ol><li>Try logging out from your Google Account and browse YouTube (anonymously). Doing this will ensure that you no longer see any highlighted comments. However, at the same time, this will restrict you from interacting in any way with that video, let alone leaving a comment.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment"><a href="#Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?"></a>Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?</h2><p>Many frequently inquire on the internet about how they can improve the chances of getting their comment pinned, as highlighted on YouTube. The secret lies in how you write the statement. We’ve listed a few pro tips below that can help:</p><ul><li>First, go through all the posted comments under the video. It will help you identify what is missing. You can comment or write the missing point in comprehendible and straightforward words. Also, never forget to acknowledge the YouTuber’s talent.</li><li>Remember, no one has the time to read long comments. So, when you know what you want to write, try to shorten your sentences. A short and crisp comment draws more attention.</li><li>After you have framed your comment, make sure that it is grammatically correct. YouTube and Google hate grammatical errors.</li><li>Do not hit the post option already. Before publishing it, you must cross-check that your comment has all the above points in place.</li><li>Lastly, you have to wait after publishing on the video’s comment section. YouTube will highlight your comment if it passes according to the YouTube policy and if the search engine finds it unique.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial"><a href="#Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?"></a>Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?</h2><p>Being a convenience feature, a highlighted comment on YouTube is 100% beneficial. That is especially true if you are looking for ways to optimize your channel.</p><p>YouTube is undeniably the second largest search engine on the web. Highlight comments can potentially increase the outreach of your content and, consequently, your brand presence.</p><p>As said earlier, these comments always show first on the comment section. Needless to say, many people who watch the videos also scroll down to the comments section to start a conversation or see what other viewers are saying about this video.</p><p>In the process, alongside the interaction, they also check out the channels or profiles of the commentators. Viewers often visit the pages of these channels, and if they happen to enjoy the video content, they will subscribe to the YouTuber’s channel. If your comment gets highlighted, your YouTube channel can be one of them.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>YouTube can be an intimidating tool for marketing and more so for newcomers. Every YouTuber wishes that their channel performs better than the previous day. Even though the highlighted comment or highlighted reply feature doesn’t have any direct benefits, it can indeed help in optimizing your YouTube channel.</p><p>It can connect you with potential viewers and increase the number of people that visit your channel regularly. However, how many of them stay and hit the “Subscribe” button is a different story altogether and is wholly based on whether they like what you share through your videos.</p><p>In this article, we have shared facts on YouTube’s commonly seen highlighted comment feature. Yet, the term is a heavily misleading one, as far as viewers and Youtuber’s are concerned. We have also covered all other aspects and queries related to this term. Here’s hoping they clarify all your doubts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UcplMvRBulA?si=iBonbwDS1v7RAlHK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-becoming-a-bull-or-bear-best-stock-vids-on-youtube/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Becoming a Bull or Bear Best Stock Vids on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-essential-audio-techniques-capturing-clear-sound/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Essential Audio Techniques Capturing Clear Sound</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-from-novice-to-vlogger-your-guide-to-creating-a-youtube-chanel/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved From Novice to Vlogger Your Guide to Creating a YouTube Chanel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-masterclass-in-visual-storytelling-for-youtube-live-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Masterclass in Visual Storytelling for YouTube Live Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-migrating-spotify-written-content-for-a-streamlined-youtube-music-experience/"><u>[New] Migrating Spotify' Written Content for a Streamlined YouTube Music Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-streamlining-the-recording-process-in-virtual-gatherings/"><u>[New] Streamlining the Recording Process in Virtual Gatherings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-guide-best-10-no-cost-games-screen-capture-tools-2024/"><u>[New] Ultimate Guide Best 10 No-Cost Games' Screen Capture Tools 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/approved-drafting-dynamic-news-endings/"><u>2024 Approved Drafting Dynamic News Endings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-into-tomorrow-latest-apps-and-gaming-on-windows-10/"><u>2024 Approved Step Into Tomorrow Latest Apps & Gaming on Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unleash-your-creativity-top-10-free-and-paid-android-video-editing-apps/"><u>New In 2024, Unleash Your Creativity Top 10 Free and Paid Android Video Editing Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice.techidaily.com/new-the-most-straightforward-guide-to-learning-how-to-clone-your-voice/"><u>New The Most Straightforward Guide to Learning How to Clone Your Voice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/-non-selected-youtube-video-suggestions-for-2024/"><u>Pause Non-Selected YouTube Video Suggestions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/phonic-finesse-master-english-with-twisters/"><u>Phonic Finesse: Master English With Twisters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/-relay-youtube-playlists-to-the-public/"><u>Rapid Relay Youtube Playlists to the Public</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/-visual-riches-from-four-premium-youtube-portals/"><u>Seize Visual Riches From Four Premium YouTube Portals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-safest-iphone-12-and-12-pro-cases-insights-and-reviews-from-zdnet/"><u>Ultimate Guide to the Safest iPhone 12 & 12 Pro Cases : Insights and Reviews From ZDNET</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Quality services, like the ones listed below, will have real people watch your videos (or at least play them all the way through while they do other things). A good turnaround period for 1 million YouTube views is between 6 and 8 months. A waiting period of a few months is necessary if you want viewer retention.</p><p>Viewer retention means someone is actually watching your video, not just clicking on it and clicking away (which is bad for your search engine ranking). Beware that almost all view buying sites will claim to sell high retention views regardless of if they do or not.</p><p>Trustworthy services often have other services available, such as Social Promotion on other social media platforms or YouTube likes and comments. These will help to encourage more organic views, likes, and comments. Also, if your views go up but you have no likes or comments then that might tip people off that you’ve bought views and while it is not against the rules there is certainly a stigma attached.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that while buying human views is not technically against YouTube’s rules and can be done safely, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying subscribers is more dangerous <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/everything-you-need-to-know--how-to-buy-youtube-views-292.html" >For even more information on buying views, click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSFNIAYChbA?si=4TIlsUrYmY5vP2il" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Where-To-Buy-1-Million-YouTube-Views"><a href="#Where-To-Buy-1-Million-YouTube-Views" class="headerlink" title="Where To Buy 1 Million YouTube Views"></a><strong>Where To Buy 1 Million YouTube Views</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="http://buyviewsreview.com/" >BuyViewsReview <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a site dedicated to helping you avoid scams that can hurt your channel.

They have a reasonable completion time of an average of 3 to 4 months for most orders, and you can stake advantage of the video SEO service for free. According to BuyViewsReview’s test, their customer service is excellent.</p><p>You can buy 1 million YouTube views for $3,497 on Devumi.</p><p> <strong>#2: BuyViews:</strong></p><p>BuyViews is another option when you’re trying to reach 1 million views on YouTube. Offering a 100% money-back guarantee just like Devumi, BuyViews’ average time of completion is slightly lower. With this service, you can also buy likes and comments or take advantage of their social promotion options.</p><p>You can buy 1 million views for $4,000 on BuyViews, which is slightly more than Devumi’s price.</p><p> <strong>#3: FastFollowerz:</strong></p><p>FastFollowersz also offers a 100% money-back guarantee. They are able to deliver on their promises, but they are in the number 3 slot because they are not totally safe – 2&#x2F;5 videos in BuyViewsReviews’ test of this service were taken down by YouTube. It also seems like the views they offer are low retention, which can hurt your channel even if your videos don’t get removed.</p><p>You can buy 1 million YouTube views for $2,800 on FastFollowerz, which is significantly less than the two higher-ranked options.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZma8PBO0D8?si=9-qQgGVTuChYd27a" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-a-vloggers-guide-to-camera-lenses-wondershare-filmora/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved A Vlogger's Guide To Camera Lenses | Wondershare Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-explore-the-best-apps-for-effortless-youtube-to-webm-conversion/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Explore the Best Apps for Effortless YouTube to WebM Conversion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-innovative-gaming-intro-options-free-versus-paid-for-youtube-creators/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Innovative Gaming Intro Options Free Versus Paid for YouTube Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-logo-luminosity-enhancing-gaming-channels-with-designs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Logo Luminosity Enhancing Gaming Channels with Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-mac-screen-alignment-rapid-video-format-changes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Mac Screen Alignment Rapid Video Format Changes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-master-photographers-tale-assembly-tool/"><u>[New] Master Photographer's Tale Assembly Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-unbeatable-online-and-desktop-gif-maker-options/"><u>[New] Unbeatable Online & Desktop GIF Maker Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-seamless-visuals-with-instagrams-chroma-key/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Seamless Visuals with Instagram's Chroma Key</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-edit-like-a-pro-with-these-top-5-mac-videography-suites/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Edit Like a Pro with These Top 5 Mac Videography Suites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/acquiring-personal-media-from-friends-social-networks-safely/"><u>Acquiring Personal Media From Friends' Social Networks Safely</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/life360-learn-how-everything-works-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Life360 Learn How Everything Works On Samsung Galaxy S24 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn’t commonplace, including a video can’t hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you’re working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.</p><p>The songs in YouTube’s library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora’s library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.</p><p>Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Bouns!

The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you’re adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● We hope you now have a better concept of how to post your song to YouTube if you’ve ever wondered. On the surface, posting songs to YouTube may appear complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it’ll be a snap. When considering how to promote your music, YouTube should not be disregarded. It’s rare to have a free platform to distribute music on, so make use of it. With such a massive YouTube user base, your potential audience is enormous. Get your song on the platform and promote it as much as possible. You never know who might come upon your tunes until you’ve made them public.

YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.</p><p>For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title"><a href="#2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="2. Use a Good Video Title"></a>2. Use a Good Video Title</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-2.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - video title"                ></p><p>The title of your video is the first thing other people see, and it’s what decides whether or not they watch it. Given how important it is, you’ll want to make sure that your title accurately reflects the content of your video and includes all relevant keywords.</p><h4 id="3-Link-Your-Videos-Directly-to-Your-Website"><a href="#3-Link-Your-Videos-Directly-to-Your-Website" class="headerlink" title="3. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website"></a>3. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website</h4><p>Each time you publish a new video, make sure you embed it on your website or blog. Not only will this encourage viewers to stay on your website instead of leaving immediately, but it will also make it easier for search engines crawlers to index your website.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Tags-To-The-Video-Description"><a href="#4-Add-Tags-To-The-Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.</p><p>When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video. So you should first add the most relevant keyword phrases then include specific multi-word tags that will easily rank on top of search results.</p><h4 id="5-Edit-The-Filename"><a href="#5-Edit-The-Filename" class="headerlink" title="5. Edit The Filename"></a>5. Edit The Filename</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-4.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - edit the file name"                ></p><p>The filename of your video, or the “video URL,” can also affect its rankings. Including keywords in this section will help the crawlers index your video faster, which will increase its chances of ranking higher.</p><h4 id="6-Add-Subtitles-and-Closed-Captions"><a href="#6-Add-Subtitles-and-Closed-Captions" class="headerlink" title="6.

Subtitles make it easier for new viewers to understand your videos, especially if your audience comes from different linguistic backgrounds.</p><h4 id="7-Select-Video-Category"><a href="#7-Select-Video-Category" class="headerlink" title="7. Select Video Category"></a>7. Select Video Category</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-6.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - select video category"                ></p><p>When uploading a video, be sure to select the most appropriate category for it. Essentially, this helps with SEO optimization because choosing the right category means that YouTube’s algorithm will place your video in the proper search results. In turn, viewers will easily find your video and watch it.</p><h4 id="8-Use-a-Compelling-Thumbnail"><a href="#8-Use-a-Compelling-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="8.

Use a Compelling Thumbnail</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-7.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - use compelling thumbnail"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5EKBEujWCw4?si=PwVvvervi8OrYaEA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Make sure you use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the right YouTube video thumbnail image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as this makes a big difference in the click-through rate. You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.</p><p>Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.</p><p>Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.</p><h4 id="9-Make-High-Quality-Longer"><a href="#9-Make-High-Quality-Longer" class="headerlink" title="9. Make High-Quality Longer"></a>9. Make High-Quality Longer</h4><p>Videos that are less than 2 minutes long often rank low. The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content. Additionally, you should create high-quality videos to ensure your viewers will keep watching.</p><h4 id="Create-High-Quality-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality YouTube Video with Filmora"></a>Create High-Quality YouTube Video with Filmora</h4><p>Wondershare’s Filmora program allows you to edit your video content with trim, transitions, and overlays.

And as you probably know, it can be tough to work fast and get good results when your hardware or laptop isn’t strong enough to power your software properly and allow you to work at the pace you want.</p><p>The best laptops for video editing in 2018 have three things in common. First, they have top-of-the-line display technology for color accuracy, color depth, and clarity. Next, they have discrete (dedicated) Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) with accompanying RAM to enable them to handle video processing fast without compromising other system functions. And finally, they have Intel core i7 CPU processors and Solid-State Drives (SSD) for faster overall performance.</p><h2 id="THE-TOP-3-LAPTOPS-FOR-EDITING-VIDEO-IN-2018"><a href="#THE-TOP-3-LAPTOPS-FOR-EDITING-VIDEO-IN-2018" class="headerlink" title="THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018"></a>THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018</h2><p>The top 3 laptops below are quite impressive. They have the right mix of power and function that video editing requires.</p><ol><li><a href="#macbook">MacBook Pro With Touch Bar</a></li><li><a href="#dell">Dell XPS 15</a></li><li><a href="#microsoft">Microsoft Surface Book 2</a></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMS5pm0SQlQ?si=gasOo6p2agrVlIb7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-MACBOOK-PRO-WITH-TOUCH-BAR"><a href="#1-MACBOOK-PRO-WITH-TOUCH-BAR" class="headerlink" title="1.MACBOOK PRO WITH TOUCH BAR"></a>1.MACBOOK PRO WITH TOUCH BAR</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-pro-touch-bar.jpg"                      alt="Macbook pro touch bar"                ></p><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $1500 - $1800</p><p><strong>SYSTEM SPECS:</strong></p><p>CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor</p><p>GRAPHICS: Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB memory – 560 with 4GB memory</p><p>RAM: 16GB</p><p>SCREEN: 15.4” Retina Display</p><p>RES: 2880 x 1800px</p><p>STORAGE: 128 – 256GB SSD</p><p><strong>PROS</strong></p><ol><li>OLED Touch Bar</li><li>Thunderbolt 3 ports</li><li>Large Trackpad</li></ol><p> <strong>CONS:</strong></p><ol><li>No other input ports available besides Thunderbolt 3</li><li>Expensive</li></ol><p> The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is the best video editing laptop produced by Apple. It has a wide 15.4” screen with thin bezels, and its proprietary OLED Touch bar amps up its flexibility and functionality considerably. The Touch Bar is set-up to show different shortcuts for different apps. It works quite well with Photoshop and will show thumbnails, filter options, a color picker, and more while you’re editing videos or stills.</p><p>Working with large 4K video files is much easier with the MacBook Pro. It’s fitted with Thunderbolt 3 Ports which have the highest data and video bandwidth available for USB-C connections. With these Thunderbolt ports, you can also use high-speed and high-power peripherals without a hitch. This laptop also has an extra-wide touchpad or Trackpad (as Apple calls it) which expands your physical working surface while also making it easier to do detailed video editing.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you need a variety of ports like most videographers, working with the MacBook Pro could be a challenge as it only has Thunderbolt 3 ports. If this is the laptop you prefer, you’ll need to buy additional connection hardware to work with different input devices. And while this laptop impresses in many ways, it’s also quite expensive. There are certainly other laptops on the market which can give you similar performance at a lower cost.</p><h3 id="2-DELL-XPS-15"><a href="#2-DELL-XPS-15" class="headerlink" title="2. DELL XPS 15"></a>2. DELL XPS 15</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dell-xps-15.jpg"                      alt="Dell XPS 15"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6xXIR_Uh1A?si=TMXzklPEY50MUM05" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $999 - $1300</p><p><strong>SYSTEM SPECS:</strong></p><p>CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor</p><p>GRAPHICS: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050</p><p>RAM: 8 - 16GB</p><p>SCREEN: 15.6”</p><p>RES: FHD - 4k UHD 3840 x 2160px</p><p>STORAGE: 256GB – 1TB SSD</p><p><strong>PROS</strong></p><ol><li>4k InfinityEdge display</li><li>Good battery life</li><li>Has multiple input ports</li></ol><p> <strong>CONS:</strong></p><ol><li>Webcam is oddly positioned</li></ol><p>The Dell XPS 15 is one laptop that hits the sweet spot for many videographers. It’s considered the closest competitor to the MacBook Pro reviewed above. In fact, many would argue that it tops the MacBook Pro when it comes to speed, color accuracy, and color depth. Its 15.6” screen has very thin bezels for minimal distraction and immersive work experience. At 4K resolution and displaying a wide range of the sRGB gamut, video editing with the Dell XPS 15 promises to be both smooth and enjoyable.</p><p>The Dell XPS 15 is certainly more affordable, while still delivering excellent graphics performance. It features an Intel i7 processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics processor. This makes it remarkably fast for video editing, as well as energy-efficient. People who work with different input devices will also like that this laptop has legacy adapters (USB, HDMI, ethernet) alongside a USB type C port.</p><p>The biggest downside to the Dell XPS 15 laptop is its oddly positioned webcam. It feels awkward and can be an inconvenience to use since you’ll have to adjust your position significantly while making video calls or recording for your YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2"><a href="#3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

At a resolution of 3240 x 2160px, its screen is nearly 4k and can handle Full HD and HD footage with ease. Add to this its capacity to show a considerable portion of the sRGB gamut and its easy-to-use stylus and you can see why this 2-in-1 combo from Microsoft is one of the top 3 laptops for video editing in 2018.</p><p>Surface Book 2 also has the right combination of power and storage capacity that video editing requires. It boasts a state-of-the-art NVIDIA graphics processor and an Intel i7 processor for a smooth workflow no matter the size or level of detail involved in your video editing project.</p><p>On the downside, this laptop is undoubtedly very expensive. Compared to the function and power you can get from the DELL XPS 15, it’s hard to justify paying nearly $2500 for the Surface Book 2. Its detachable screen, supported by a fulcrum hinge, also comes at a price. It makes the laptop a bit bulky at one end when it’s folded. This in turn can make day-to-day handling a bit more tricky than it has to be.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3PFn06LijE?si=zHrmlTOzrKxXe-k4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2><p>If you’re searching for a good laptop to help you improve the quality of your videos in 2018, look no further than these 3. They have all the power, function, and storage capacity you need to handle any project with ease. Just be mindful of your budget and consider which extras are worth the expense. Go for the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar if customizing your workflow is a priority. Opt for the Dell XPS 15 if you want the best combination of display quality and graphics processing. Finally, consider the Surface Book 2 if you need the flexibility of a 2-in-1 device.</p><p> What do you think is the best laptop for video editing?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NC0rdKEQ98o?si=HYgqC8CxF_WTO5if" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Equip-Your-Laptop-with-the-Best-Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#Equip-Your-Laptop-with-the-Best-Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Equip Your Laptop with the Best Video Editing Software"></a>Equip Your Laptop with the Best Video Editing Software</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-enhance-visibility-with-any-channel-title-through-free-makers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Enhance Visibility With Any Channel Title Through Free Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-youtube-video-shooting-equipment-choosing-guide/"><u>[New] In 2024, YouTube Video Shooting Equipment Choosing Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-is-facebook-better-for-vertical-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Is Facebook Better for Vertical Videos?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-richest-revenue-generators-in-the-youtube-universe/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Richest Revenue Generators in the YouTube Universe</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-enhance-audio-quality-get-high-quality-fx/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Enhance Audio Quality, Get High-Quality FX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-how-to-add-chapters-to-youtube-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Add Chapters to YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-screen-logger-suite/"><u>2024 Approved Ultimate Screen Logger Suite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/erating-engagement-with-optimized-youtube-video-speeds/"><u>Accelerating Engagement with Optimized YouTube Video Speeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://novels-ebooks.techidaily.com/1125608-9781609254759-bucklands-book-of-saxon-witchcraft/"><u>Buckland's Book of Saxon Witchcraft | Free Book</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/script-to-splendor-animating-effects-unbound-for-2024/"><u>From Script to Splendor Animating Effects Unbound for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-can-oppo-find-n3mirror-share-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How Can Oppo Find N3Mirror Share to PC?

Let’s discuss this scenario in detail in this article!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>YouTube’s TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, is now rocking globally. Seeing the success of Instagram Reels and TikTok, it seems like YouTube didn’t want to lag behind the game. So in September last year, it decided to step into short-form content via YouTube Shorts, a social platform for quick 60-second videos hosted on the YouTube app.</p><p>According to the Shorts product lead <strong>Todd Sherman</strong>, the social media giant aims to unleash new grounds for creativity.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok is a short-form, video-sharing app that assists users to share and make 15-second to 60-seconds videos on any topic.</p><p>TikTok contains a separate app for the Chinese market, <strong>Douyin</strong>, with 300 million-plus active monthly users. The new app’s logo is a merger of the Duyin and Musical.ly logos.</p><p>And, we’re going to discuss the comparison of both these giants, i.e., <strong>YouTube</strong> <strong>Shorts vs. TikTok</strong>, in terms of which app is better for making short videos.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Is-YouTube-Shorts-the-New-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-Is-YouTube-Shorts-the-New-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is YouTube Shorts the New TikTok?"></a>Part 1: Is YouTube Shorts the New TikTok?</h2><p>In general, we can’t say that YouTube Shorts is the new TikTok because YouTube Shorts is YouTube’s expansion and have its own identity than TikTok.</p><p>YouTube Shorts is playing hand in hand with TikTok as the short-form video platform, but the Shorts integration with the broader ecosystem of YouTube is its key selling point according to Google’s service.</p><p>Ironically, while YouTube is laying ways to emulate TikTok’s format, TikTok is experimenting with formats that are closer to YouTube’s traditional focus. This is why TikTok has tripled its maximum video length to three minutes for everyone and has been developing apps slowly on TV platforms like Fire TV and Android TV.</p><p>At a glance, YouTube Shorts looks pretty similar to TikTok. However, there are certain TikTok features that even the Shorts product manager Todd Sherman disagrees with is that of the YouTube Shorts. Sherman said the way TikTok works is quite an industry-wide standard than the point of view of any single app.</p><p>Even though YouTube is quite late to the short-form content game, it has a strong brand of YouTube behind it.</p><p>Thus, saying that “YouTube Shorts is the new TikTok” doesn’t even qualify in terms of the $100 million fund sanctioned for the creators of YouTube Shorts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: What Are the Similarities and Differences?"></a>Part 2: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: What Are the Similarities and Differences?</h2><p>In this section, we’ve defined the analysis of <strong>YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok</strong> in the form of both a comparison table and specific points of similarities and differences.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Basis of Comparison</strong></th><th><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong></th><th><strong>TikTok</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Video Length&#x2F;Duration</strong></td><td>Up to 60 seconds</td><td>Up to 3 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>9:16</td><td>9:16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video Captions&#x2F;Description</strong></td><td>You can find the video title in the exact location as the TikTok caption, but the description is visible only after users click on the three dots.</td><td>Video captions are located at the bottom left.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Placement of Analytics</strong></td><td>YouTube Studio</td><td>TikTok app itself</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dislike Button</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Section-1-The-Similarities-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok"><a href="#Section-1-The-Similarities-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. The Similarities Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok"></a>Section 1. The Similarities Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok</h3><ul><li>Both these platforms are for short-form video content.</li><li>The TikTok and YouTube Shorts both assist creators in adding music from their audio libraries, and users can view all videos beneath the audio library.</li><li>Both offer analytics, including video views, likes, comments, watch time, shares, impressions, and reach. You can view these analytics on a desktop or mobile device for both platforms.</li><li>The Shorts and TikTok feed provide a full-screen immersive experience with the engagement menu shown on the right-hand panel.</li><li>Their feeds scroll in the same manner. Plus, there is an endless number of videos lined up for users to discover and watch. Yet, there’s no auto-scroll on either, and users must scroll manually for the following video to come up.</li><li>Both provide tools that assist creators in earning money from their content creation.</li><li>Users can subscribe or follow creators directly from their videos in both feeds.</li><li>Both offer creators the ability to alter their video content’s speed and help them to set timers with the filming process.</li><li>YouTube Shorts TikTok give creators the ability to upload video content they’ve previously filmed.</li><li>You can add closed captions and overlaying text to both of these platforms.</li><li>They both assist creators in setting a video for the public, so anyone can view it or set it to private.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-mXUpVQijU?si=f1MzflPJ8-bD2_iQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Section-2-The-Differences-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok"><a href="#Section-2-The-Differences-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Section 2. The Differences Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok"></a>Section 2. The Differences Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok</h3><ul><li>The monetization features of both these platforms are entirely different. Shorts offer their ‘Shorts fund,’ whereas TikTok provides Shoutouts and Digital Gifts.</li><li>Shorts can only be 60-seconds long, whereas TikTok’s can be as long as three minutes (it could soon be stretched to five minutes duration as per their recent test).</li><li>TikTok allows users to add video captions that are present in the bottom left area of TikTok. At the same time, users can add a video title in Shorts which is present in the exact location as a TikTok caption. And, a video description that is only viewable when users click the three dots above the link button and click ‘Description’ can be in YouTube Shorts.</li><li>YouTube has a large music library which gives users an abundance of undiscovered and popular songs to select from, possibly more than the TikTok offerings list.</li><li>TikTok has a vast library of filters, including greenscreen and AR effects, whereas Shorts only provides filters that edit the video’s tone, temperature, brightness, etc.</li><li>Shorts’ ‘private’ video option allows creators to choose or see who watches your video. On the other hand, TikTok’s ‘private’ video option only allows the creator to view the video.</li><li>You can view the TikTok analytics directly in the TikTok app. On the other hand, YouTube Shorts analytics can be visible in YouTube Studio.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq2r4ZKM-Po?si=fA2DdEB1op-atCkz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Features-TikTok-has-but-YouTube-Shorts-does-not…"><a href="#Features-TikTok-has-but-YouTube-Shorts-does-not…" class="headerlink" title="Features TikTok has, but YouTube Shorts does not…"></a>Features TikTok has, but YouTube Shorts does not…</h3><ul><li>A stitch and duet feature, where users can add other creators’ videos to their accounts.</li><li>A Q&amp;A feature to leave questions for creators to answer with a video.

Thus, even though it keeps up the promise of creating, watching, and sharing both long and short-form content, it may turn away those who prefer focused access to quick content. Regardless, with YouTube Shorts now starting to become available to more users, the battle in the viral video market with TikTok is sure to heat up.</p><p>Before giving you our opinion on which is the better platform for short video promotion, go through the following conversation first.</p><p>Ramona Pringle is an associate professor and a tech expert at Toronto’s Ryerson University. She said in an interview that because YouTube already has figured out video content, the transformation to add short-form video will be natural.</p><p>She also mentioned that YouTube Shorts is the platform best placed with the competition from TikTok than all other platforms. However, YouTube doesn’t need to be TikTok as it has its strategies and broad audience base.</p><p>Like Pringle, Matt Navarra, a social media consultant based in the U.K., said in an interview that Shorts is a logical evolution and extension of YouTube, which has further given rise to TikTok. But unlike TikTok, Shorts has a few features that it can take benefit from. Among these features is the extensive audio library content, the greater scope for users to remix and create duets and stuff from scratch. Undoubtedly, you can’t deny the experience of YouTube in terms of access to partnerships with the music industry and licensing.</p><p>Thus, keeping all these factors in mind, we’d like to conclude that both the YouTube Shorts and TikTok are great and considerable platforms for short video promotion. Still, we’d like to place YouTube Shorts in the upper place due to its global availability. Whereas TikTok is already banned in certain countries.</p><p>It also depends upon the audience base of the country as to which platform is in use the most. Suppose it’s TikTok that people primarily use in a particular country or location where the brand wants to advertise itself. In that case, going with TikTok for short video promotion is better and vice versa.</p><p>To get more information, click the following video!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vfq0vw0Spz8?si=2EAk6hW-Gb-o33_L" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice"><a href="#TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice" class="headerlink" title="TikTok or YouTube?

Digital rights protection"></a>2. Digital rights protection</h3><p>The functioning of a YouTube MCN is not only restricted to revenue generation or brand promotion. They also take care of your channel, when you face copyright strikes that otherwise results in losing money and other advanced YouTube features. The MCN handles the copyright management issues, while you concentrate on creating engaging and valuable content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/digital-rights-protectation.JPG"                      alt="digital rights protectation"                ></p><h3 id="3-Collaborations-with-other-YouTubers"><a href="#3-Collaborations-with-other-YouTubers" class="headerlink" title="3. Collaborations with other YouTubers"></a>3. Collaborations with other YouTubers</h3><p>These MCNs allow you to collaborate with other YouTube channels and enhance your business exposure. In such a case you getter better foothold in the YouTube network, as other YouTubers in your network share the videos within the community and allow it to get more views. When such a larger audience is consuming your content, there are higher chances of getting the best out of MCN.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collaboration.JPG"                      alt="collaboration"                ></p><h3 id="4-Better-video-production-facilities"><a href="#4-Better-video-production-facilities" class="headerlink" title="4.

These MCNs ensure that you get the tools and technology like studio equipment to create and edit videos. Top-notch post-production tools are also available with them to boost your channel’s videos.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Cons-of-joining-MCN-YouTube-network"><a href="#Part-3-Cons-of-joining-MCN-YouTube-network" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Cons of joining MCN YouTube network"></a>Part 3: Cons of joining MCN YouTube network</h2><p>You should never ignore the downside of every step you take while grooming your YouTube channel to touch the heights of success. Here are few of the prominent drawbacks of joining any MCN YouTube network.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oySc0DiqmKc?si=8pynRzuhlq2RUPZ6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Split-revenue"><a href="#1-Split-revenue" class="headerlink" title="1. Split revenue"></a>1. Split revenue</h3><p>Although, YouTube clearly doesn’t mention the revenue you will generate from your YouTube channel under the YouTube partner agreement. Your channel and YouTube respectively share 55&#x2F;45 revenue. When you take help from your MCN the 55% earnings will further deteriorate after paying a percentage of your AdSense revenue to them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/revenue.JPG"                      alt="revenue"                ></p><h3 id="2-Outcome-is-not-always-exciting"><a href="#2-Outcome-is-not-always-exciting" class="headerlink" title="2. Outcome is not always exciting"></a>2. Outcome is not always exciting</h3><p>If you are thinking that the viewership will jump up multi-fold after involving a MCN, then you need to hold on and rethink. It is not guaranteed that a MCN will always end up giving you more view and subscribers to your channel, though it happens with some people.</p><p>Go through what you will be gaining from the YouTube MCN in terms of promoting your videos, promotional offers and increasing the subscriber as well as boosting your channel’s exposure.</p><p>Any MCN won’t guarantee you for achieving a specific number of subscribers or views if you join them. It’s important to work out what is important for us and for what reasons you are teaming up with that MCN.</p><p>In case there is no ROI for you with a YouTube MCN then it’s better to be on your own and try hard to enhance the reach and revenue. Without an ROI, it is futile to sacrifice your earnings in vain.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBCobAYzzcc?si=J3eSTQ3AdyxWAjGo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-bottom-line"><a href="#The-bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="The bottom line"></a>The bottom line</h2><p>If you are asking us that you should join a YouTube MCN, then we would recommend you that the decision lies with you. As a YouTube channel owner and content creator, you have a certain goal to achieve.</p><p>So, it’s you who needs to figure out the important steps to be taken for attaining all the short and long term goals. Weigh your options and then opt for MCNs, if their assistance and service are close to meeting your expectations with your YouTube channel.</p><p>To decide whether to go for a YouTube network partnership or not, first check what percentage of your revenue they will be charging. It’s a key constraint for deciding about the viability of the partnership. If after calculating the proposed revenue sharing you have substantial profits, then going with the MCN is worth it.</p><p>The next point is the term of the contract. Never go for contracts that stretch for a longer duration. Put more stress on the legal contracts with the help of a professional lawyer. You need to be very careful about rights, termination of contracts and the likes. Though, we won’t be elaborately explaining the legal decisions involved in officially joining any YouTube network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-channel-your-creativity-convert-youtube-clips-into-dynamic-gifs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Channel Your Creativity Convert YouTube Clips Into Dynamic Gifs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-efficient-ways-to-document-gotomeeting-sessions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Efficient Ways to Document GoToMeeting Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-from-passive-to-active-earnings-unlocking-youtube-with-500plus-fans/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved From Passive to Active Earnings Unlocking Youtube with 500+ Fans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-making-youtube-videos-come-alive-your-ultimate-guide-to-animated-gifs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Making YouTube Videos Come Alive Your Ultimate Guide To Animated GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/-step-by-step-guide-through-youtubes-aspect-ratio-landscapes/"><u>[New] A Step-by-Step Guide Through YouTube's Aspect Ratio Landscapes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-youtube-conversion-mastery-top-10-strategies-revealed/"><u>[New] In 2024, YouTube Conversion Mastery Top 10 Strategies Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-the-top-ten-webcam-enhancers-master-stream-quality-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Top-Ten Webcam Enhancers Master Stream Quality for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-youtubes-earnings-go-up-with-500-subs/"><u>[Updated] YouTube's Earnings Go Up With 500 Subs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/disabling-recording-privacy-focused-tips-for-chatgpt-users/"><u>Disabling Recording: Privacy-Focused Tips for ChatGPT Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-some-pro-tips-for-pokemon-go-pvp-battles-on-apple-iphone-x-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Here are Some Pro Tips for Pokemon Go PvP Battles On Apple iPhone X | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/mastering-app-success-elevating-your-profile-on-apple-tv-channels/"><u>Mastering App Success: Elevating Your Profile on Apple TV Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-12-sign-bio-blueprints-on-whatsapp/"><u>The Ultimate 12-Sign Bio Blueprints on WhatsApp</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/1723808318828-top-game-torrents-at-a-glance-navigating-the-best-free-downloading-portals/"><u>Top Game Torrents at a Glance: Navigating the Best Free Downloading Portals.</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The best way to grow your channel is to focus on putting out quality content consistently. We do not recommend the following methods, but they do exist. Here are a couple of alternatives to purchasing views which are along those same lines (if you want to know how to grow organically without resorting to tactics like these, <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/14-tactics-that-actually-work%21-how-to-gain-more-subscribers-300.html" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) When YouTube first started, getting views and subscribers was a lot easier. That’s not to say that creator didn’t have to work hard on their channels, just that they had a lot less competition.</p><p>YouTube has become so popular now that it is not uncommon for creators to look for alternative ways to stand out.

After you sign up, you will need to start watching videos from other YouTube publishers who are also members at View2be in order to earn coins. One of the differences between View2be and other view exchange platforms is that here, you can also complete some other tasks such as liking videos in order to earn more coins.</p><p>You can then spend the coins on views and likes for your own videos.</p><h4 id="2-GrowViews"><a href="#2-GrowViews" class="headerlink" title="2.

One of the main advantages of using the KingdomLikes is that you can also use this same platform to get likes or views on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, as well as on YouTube.</p><p>Just like with the other platforms, you will need to watch other people’s videos in order to earn views for yourself.</p><h4 id="5-AddVisits"><a href="#5-AddVisits" class="headerlink" title="5.

Once your video is approved, you define how many points you are willing to give to people who watch your videos or like them. In exchange, you watch other people’s videos and get points as compensation. You can then exchange those points for more views or likes.</p><h2 id="2-Get-More-Views-with-YouTube-View-Bots"><a href="#2-Get-More-Views-with-YouTube-View-Bots" class="headerlink" title="#2: Get More Views with YouTube View Bots"></a>#2: Get More Views with YouTube View Bots</h2><p>When most people think about getting free views on YouTube, they immediately think about bots.</p><p>Bots can be dangerous for your channel. The wrong bot can really hurt your search rankings and if you get caught using bots you can lose your account.</p><p>If you are going to try a bot, make sure you choose one that offers high retention views (most can’t, but may say they can). High retention views mean YouTube interprets the data as someone watching your video for a period of time, vs just clicking on it and then leaving the page.

Some even go so far to compare <strong>IGTV to YouTube</strong>, currently, the largest video sharing platform in the world that hosts 300 minutes of video each minute. IGTV may have fewer users than YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to use it effectively for a wide array of different purposes. So, in this article, we are going to take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of each platform in order to help you discover how you can utilize each of these social networks to broaden the audience for the content you share online.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Reels VS Instagram Stories–Everything You Need to Know &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: Which One Is Better? &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdVT_-3gESA?si=_HfjpbUEHSRKTXjt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference"><a href="#IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference"></a>IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference</h2><p>Comparison between IGTV and YouTube is somewhat unfair towards the former since IGTV is a much younger platform that still needs time to develop. YouTube, on the other hand, has a reputation as one of the most reliable video sharing platforms ever created that enables people from all walks of life to upload and share music, movies, gaming videos and virtually any other type of moving images. Even so, let’s take a look at major differences and similarities between IGTV and YouTube.</p><h4 id="Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences"><a href="#Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Have a Quick Glance of the Differences"></a>Have a Quick Glance of the Differences</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Interface Differences</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">The Upload Process</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Discovering New Content</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part4">Monetization</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part5">Analytics and Insights</a></p><h4 id="1-Interface-Differences"><a href="#1-Interface-Differences" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface Differences"></a>1. Interface Differences</h4><p>Despite the fact that you can access IGTV from a web browser, this platform is predominantly dedicated to videos that are going to be watched on mobile devices. This also means that the thumbnails of the videos you uploaded to your IGTV channel are going to be displayed differently than those on your YouTube channel. The interfaces of these two social networks are entirely different, but if you are a newcomer to each of these platforms you won’t have much trouble getting used to them.</p><h4 id="2-The-Upload-Process"><a href="#2-The-Upload-Process" class="headerlink" title="2. The Upload Process"></a>2. The Upload Process</h4><p>The fact that you can only upload vertically oriented videos to IGTV somewhat limits your options because you either have to record a video for IGTV specifically or you must edit a horizontally oriented video and change its aspect ratio to 9:16. You can upload videos to YouTube and IGTV directly from your computer or you can use iPhone and Android-based apps to capture videos with your phone and upload them to either of these platforms. The maximum duration of an IGTV video can’t exceed sixty minutes, while the default duration of all videos on YouTube is set to 15 minutes. Nonetheless, if you own a verified YouTube account, you can upload videos that have 128GB and last up to 12 hours.</p><p>At the moment the videos you want to upload to your IGTV channel have to be saved in the MP4 file format because the platform still doesn’t offer support for any other video file format. YouTube grants much more freedom in this respect as it allows you to upload videos saved in AVI, FLV, MOV, MP4 and other commonly used file formats.</p><h4 id="3-Discovering-New-Content"><a href="#3-Discovering-New-Content" class="headerlink" title="3. Discovering New Content"></a>3. Discovering New Content</h4><p>IGTV is more than a decade younger than YouTube, so you shouldn’t be surprised if you’re having trouble discovering new content. Moreover, IGTV’s search engine is still relatively new and it is much less powerful than the one used by YouTube. This is the reason why the videos you upload to your YouTube channel are going to be much easier to find via a simple Google search than those you shared on IGTV. Besides, YouTube offers much more new content on a daily basis than IGTV, and it is clear that the Instagram’s new brainchild still has ways to go before it reaches the point when it can challenge the largest video sharing platform in the world in terms of diversity of the content that it delivers to its users.</p><h4 id="4-Monetization"><a href="#4-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="4. Monetization"></a>4. Monetization</h4><p>At the moment, views and likes can’t be monetized on IGTV, so most influencers rely on sponsorships from brands. Things may change as the platform grows, but for the time being IGTV doesn’t provide the content creators with any compensation for the work they are putting in. YouTube allows content creators to monetize their videos through Google Adsense for years, and some of its most prominent users like PewDiePie or Logan Paul have earned hundreds of millions of dollars by posting new content on their YouTube channels. Keep in mind that you are going to need at least a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of viewing time before you can enable YouTube’s Monetize feature.</p><h4 id="5-Analytics-and-Insights"><a href="#5-Analytics-and-Insights" class="headerlink" title="5. Analytics and Insights"></a>5. Analytics and Insights</h4><p>Knowing how many people watched the entire video or how many likes and comments certain types of videos get can help you produce content that attracts a larger audience on all social networks. The metrics such as engagement or view-through rates can be essential during online marketing campaigns as they can suggest how many people are watching your videos and for how long. The analytics tools YouTube provides are much more diverse than those offered by IGTV that only lets you see the audience retention graph and the number of views and comments a video currently has. YouTube is an obviously a much better option for anyone who wants to conduct an in-depth analysis of their content’s performance, although the tools on IGTV are still powerful enough to indicate which type of content your audience likes the most.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zgwn5kVI5V4?si=1j6j4OuSSndFieXU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes"><a href="#Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?"></a>Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?</h2><p>You shouldn’t assume that you can post the same type of videos on your YouTube and IGTV channels, just because they are both video sharing platforms. The content you create for your IGTV channel needs to be dynamic and entertaining in order to captivate the audience’s attention. Posting tutorials or hour-long gaming videos on IGTV won’t attract as many viewers as on YouTube, which is why businesses who want to use IGTV to promote their products and services need to choose the content carefully. Furthermore, the videos that last between two and five minutes are still by far the most popular on IGTV, so even though technically you can upload a video that lasts one hour to your IGTV channel, the chances are that such long videos won’t get a lot of views.</p><p>IGTV is probably best used as a tool that can help improve the engagement with your followers on Instagram, but if you want to become an established video content creator, then running a YouTube channel is simply a much better option. It still remains to be seen how will IGTV evolve in the years to come, but at the present moment this platform doesn’t really have any chance of challenging YouTube’s position as the world’s leading video sharing platform.</p><p>However, no matter which video platform you choose, you need to ensure the videos you create are of high quality. A good video editing software like Filmora can help you acheive this goal.</p><p><strong>Useful Features of Filmora</strong></p><ul><li>Cokor Matching: Apply color correction setting to multiple clips on one-click.</li><li>Effects: Create blockbuster videos with preset effects.</li><li>Motion Tracking: Track moving items and add elements to it at ease.</li><li>And more waiting for you to discover.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PD0vq5qAYkw?si=5H3KWtCfUOYg1Nlv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;
