Your text only appears when a viewer’s cursor hovers over top of these annotations.</p><p><strong>Labels</strong> are like spotlights except that viewers do not have to hover over them for your text to be visible.</p><p>Any of these annotations can be used to link viewers to other videos, or as subscribe links. You can also add a simple <strong>Title</strong> to your video through the Annotations menu.</p><p><strong>Section 2: How to Use Annotations</strong></p><p>*Note: the above video mentions Pause annotations, which are no longer available.</p><p>Here are two of the best uses for annotations:</p><p><strong>Clickable End Cards &#x2F; Outros</strong></p><p>One of the best ways you can use spotlight annotations is to create clickable end cards for your videos.</p><p>When your video finishes playing the YouTube player will display a selection of suggested videos that might direct viewers away from your channel. You can keep more of these viewers watching your content by creating your own ‘suggested videos’ card and putting it at the end of your videos.</p><p>Put thumbnails of two or three of your other videos on your end card, or use ‘picture-in-picture’ to actually imbed footage from them. Then, after you upload your video, go in and place clickable spotlight annotations over top of your video thumbnails.</p><p>This is one use for annotations that cannot be duplicated with cards.</p><p><strong>Promoting Your Videos</strong></p><p>You should not wait until the end of your video to start linking viewers to other content. Many viewers will click away before they see your end card because your video is not exactly what they were looking for. By placing note or speech bubble annotations occasionally throughout your videos you can catch some of these people before they click off of your channel.</p><p>This works especially well if you link to videos on similar subjects to the one you are annotating.</p><p>Instead of just linking to another video of yours, try to link to that video on a playlist. Once a viewer is on a playlist your videos will auto-play after each other, which is good for both your view count and watch time.</p><p>You can also use the newer YouTube Cards for this, but Annotations might still be a better choice because viewers only need to click once vs. twice for Cards.</p><p>Try both and see which performs best for your channel. It might be in your best interest to keep on using both as they target different audiences – Cards are clickable on mobile devices, for example, but Annotations are not.</p><h4 id="Part-2-YouTube-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: YouTube Cards"></a><strong>Part 2: YouTube Cards</strong></h4><p>YouTube Cards are newer than annotations and a lot of people believe they will one day replace Annotations. While there are benefits to Cards – like embedding images to represent your links – you cannot choose the shape, size, or placement of them. This means they have limited uses.</p><p>When viewers click on a Card they are shown additional information and a thumbnail representing the page they will be taken to if they choose to click again. This extra step could be either help viewers decide to click your links or give them a second chance to decide they would rather not.</p><p><strong>Section 1: When to Use Cards</strong></p><p>A linked Annotation is simply a call to action viewers can click on. A Card is a call to action as well, but instead of taking the viewer directly to where its link leads when it is clicked a Card opens up into a larger version of itself with a thumbnail image.</p><p>Crowdfunding pages (Patreon is a great choice for video creators), charity fundraising pages, and merchandise stores are all examples of links that benefit from the format of YouTube Cards.</p><p>When you link a viewer to a non-YouTube page you break up their session time, which negatively impacts your watch time and SEO ranking. You want to make sure that the viewers you are directing away from YouTube are the ones most likely to convert after they leave. By ‘convert’ we mean to contribute to your Patreon campaign, donate to the charity you are promoting, or buy some of your merchandise.</p><p>Giving viewers more information and a thumbnail through a Card can help ensure the most interested viewers are the ones clicking your links.</p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software Filmora, which is equipped with its own footage stock <strong><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmstocks.com/?fs_channel=ws" >Wondershare Filmstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></strong> and will definitely enhance your productivity and helps you to make money by making videos much easier.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-cutting-edge-strategies-for-recording-slideshows/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Cutting-Edge Strategies for Recording Slideshows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/oosting-audio-quality-in-social-media-recordings/"><u>[New] Boosting Audio Quality in Social Media Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-expert-take-on-camstudios-recorder-efficacy/"><u>[New] Expert Take on CamStudio's Recorder Efficacy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-beginners-bible-to-your-youtube-audio-visual-arsenal/"><u>[New] In 2024, Beginner's Bible to Your YouTube Audio-Visual Arsenal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/aucous-revelations-top-10-scenarios-for-comedy-driven-videography/"><u>[New] Raucous Revelations Top 10 Scenarios for Comedy-Driven Videography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-elevating-your-youtube-experience-tips-on-channel-art-and-sizes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Elevating Your YouTube Experience Tips on Channel Art and Sizes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-defeating-darkness-in-youtube-videos/"><u>[Updated] Defeating Darkness in Youtube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-perfecting-yt-aesthetics-in-depth-guide-to-banner-and-art-sizing/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Perfecting YT Aesthetics In-Depth Guide to Banner & Art Sizing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-optimizing-multichannel-video-series-via-strategic-chaptering-in-youtube-videos/"><u>[Updated] Optimizing Multichannel Video Series via Strategic Chaptering in YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discords-premier-love-and-fun-sites/"><u>2024 Approved Discord's Premier Love and Fun Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-transforming-web-popularity-into-video-concepts-using-google-trends/"><u>2024 Approved Transforming Web Popularity Into Video Concepts Using Google Trends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-best.techidaily.com/aomei-backupper-fur-die-vollstandige-datenwiederherstellung-auf-festplatten-expertenratshandbuch/"><u>AOMEI Backupper Für Die Vollständige Datenwiederherstellung Auf Festplatten -

You will mostly realize that the best days of the week to post to your channel are on weekends. It is quite typical as it’s the days when viewers are more relaxed and can find new things online. However, you can monitor your statistics and learn the number of days per week you need to emphasize more on posting your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-4.png"                      alt="choose the best days to post on youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006960/19272" target="_top" id="2006960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Post videos a day before the peak day<br>You can also dwell on the narrative; the early bird catches the worm. You can make an early catch since you know the day when your viewers will throng’ your channel, but you don’t know the time. Post videos a day before your channel goes busy. By this, you won’t leave any viewers outside your new postings.</p><p>A few hours before prime time<br>Another trick is to get your videos posted in good time. Once you have known the best hour of the day when viewers are likely to be active, make your video available a few hours before then. They’ll then get it rolling once they land into the channel for the newest updates. If not, you may miss out on views you would have gotten by making your video go public earlier.</p><p>Upload your videos in private a few hours before publishing<br>Yes, mistakes do happen, and you don’t want to be caught up in the mix of errors. You can increase perfection by uploading your videos for some hours before publishing them. It will give you a good time to check it out privately and iron out any concerns. You don’t want your video going viral with tons of mishaps.</p><h2 id="Create-High-Quality-Video-with-Filmora-to-Ensure-Video-Engagement"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-Video-with-Filmora-to-Ensure-Video-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality Video with Filmora to Ensure Video Engagement"></a>Create High-Quality Video with Filmora to Ensure Video Engagement</h2><p>Besides knowing the best days to post on YouTube, you have to give your audience quality for their time.

Former PayPal employees Chad Hurley, Steven Chen and Jawed Karim founded YouTube in 2005 and only a year later their platform was one of the world’s fastest growing websites, surpassing MySpace with more than 100 million video views in the July of the same year. It wasn’t long before YouTube was purchased by Google on November 13. 2006 and since then the world’s most popular video sharing platform has grown continuously.</p><p>In 2017, more than 500 hours of video content are being uploaded to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> each minute, and over 1.5 billion active users utilize it to share their memories, music they love, business ideas or anything else they feel strongly about. The following infographic will present some of the most interesting YouTube facts and statistics that will enable you to understand better one of the most popular websites ever created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/mind-blowing-youtube-stats-facts-2017.jpg"                      alt="mind blowing youtube stats facts 2017"                ></p><p>It’s hard to pick highlights from such an interesting and comprehensive read, but a couple of key stats shine out.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube has just 0,5 billion users less than Facebook</strong></li></ul><p>Mark Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the best-known business geniuses who made his fortune by creating the social network everyone wanted to be a part of. With more than 2 billion active users Facebook is the largest online community on the Internet today. YouTube has 1.5 billion active monthly users which makes it the second largest platform of its kind, well ahead of Instagram, LinkedIn or Twitter.</p><ul><li><strong>People aged 24 to 44 watch the most videos on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p>This information isn’t particularly surprising since younger generations use the Internet more frequently than the older ones. 49% of all YouTube users are aged between 24 and 44, but this statistic will likely change in the future since YouTube’s popularity can only increase. What comes in as a surprise is the fact that men spend 24% more time on YouTube than women. Could it be that men are more interested in music, short videos or promotional business videos than women or perhaps, women are simply more practical and thus tend to spend less time aimlessly going through endless video content.</p><ul><li><strong>9% of the videos are taken down because of the copyright infringements</strong></li></ul><p>At one point in the early 2000’s, it seemed as if the copyright laws will be changed forever by the Internet. Since then countless initiatives have prevented YouTube users to view, upload or share content that they don’t have the permission to use. In 2017, 9% of all videos uploaded on YouTube are taken down by the copyright holders. This means that YouTubers must make sure that all content they upload is unique or that they at least have a permission to use it.</p><ul><li><strong>An average person spends 40 minutes on YouTube each day</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube is probably one of the best pastimes the Internet can offer, and for that reason, a common person spends 40 minutes on YouTube per day. When you add an average life expectancy into the equation the math shows that during their lifetimes, people spend nearly 2 years on YouTube, or 1 year and 10 months to be exact.</p><ul><li><strong>Pop music singers are the most popular celebrities on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p>Naturally, music is the most searched term on YouTube, and celebrities like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry or Rihana have millions of subscribers with billions of total video views. Unlike Facebook where the most popular celebrities are Christiano Ronaldo or Vin Diesel, an actor and a football player, YouTube stars are mostly musicians and Pop Culture icons whose music is available to fans across the globe because of this platform. Some of the historically most viewed videos on YouTube are Luis Fonsi’s Despacito, Psy’s Gangnam Style or Tayler Swift’s Shake it Off that all have a staggering amount of views.</p><p>Let us know what you think about these interesting facts about YouTube in the comments below and feel free to share this article with your friends and colleagues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-freeze-your-favorite-moves-explore-these-top-9-windows-gif-recipes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Freeze Your Favorite Moves!

Many newbies to videography, though, don’t think about this when they use their camera indoors and discover that their recorded footage appears too dark.</p><p>If you want to use your camera indoors as many YouTubers do, you’ll need to have extra light. But the solution is not as simple as surrounding yourself with lamps that are all randomly placed.</p><p>Below, I’ll go into detail on how you can set up your lighting equipment to make your YouTube videos look good.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Table of Contents <a href="#USING-LIGHT-YOU-ALREADY-HAVE">Using Light You Already Have</a> <a href="#Window-Lighting">Window Lighting</a><a href="#Home-Lighting">Home Lighting</a> <a href="#HOME-STUDIO-LIGHTING">Home Studio Lighting</a> <a href="#Light-Control">Light Control</a><a href="#Three-Point-Lighting">3-Point Lighting</a><a href="#four-point-lighting">4-Point Lighting</a></th></tr></thead></table><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Using-Light-You-Already-Have"><a href="#Part-1-Using-Light-You-Already-Have" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Using Light You Already Have"></a>Part 1: Using Light You Already Have</h2><p>Most beginner YouTubers light their videos with what they already have. That’s what I did to start as well. In the past, my video recording space consisted of natural sunlight coming from my window and ceiling light for times when the sunlight wasn’t strong enough.</p><h3 id="1-Window-Lighting"><a href="#1-Window-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="1.  Window Lighting"></a>1.  Window Lighting</h3><p>The best thing about window lighting is that it’s free. The worst thing about it is that it’s uncontrollable. The amount of light you get in your video can vary with all the changes in the weather.</p><p>Window lighting for me was especially difficult to work with because I live in a very rainy and cloudy city, Vancouver, Canada, where we pretty much just get three months of good sun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-lighting-comparison.jpg"                      alt="  YouTube Video Lighting "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Above are two freeze frames from one of Daniel’s past window-lit vlogs. Although these two frames are both from the same vlog, you can see that the image on the right looks brighter due to clearer skies at that moment. These varying amounts of light is what you will have to deal with if you choose to light your YouTube video with window lighting.</p><h3 id="2-Home-Lighting"><a href="#2-Home-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. Home Lighting"></a>2. Home Lighting</h3><p>Home lighting is another source of light that many new YouTubers use. In the past, when my window light wasn’t strong enough to light my video recording space, I would turn on the ceiling light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-lighting-for-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="Mixed Lighting"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137221/26400" target="_top" id="2137221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137221/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Notice how the color of Daniel’s skin looks much more orange here (above) than the color of the skin in the two side-by-side window lighting examples? The side of the face also appears to look bluer. This all happened because he mixed up different color temperatures shining out of the two lights (cooler window light and warmer ceiling light).</p><p>Most home lighting is warmer in its color temperature. If you want to use your home lights without everything being orange-tinted, you’ll need to switch out your light bulbs for daytime LED light bulbs.</p><p>Ceiling lights are also typically situated in the center of a room in order to light an entire room evenly. This is not likely to be the best location for your filming video. Since the ceiling light was directly above the face in the above example, you can see harder shadows beneath his cheeks.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Home-Studio-Lighting"><a href="#Part-2-Home-Studio-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Home Studio Lighting"></a>Part 2: Home Studio Lighting</h2><p>If you rather not deal with all the window and home lighting challenges, you can set up studio lighting in your home.</p><h3 id="1-Light-Control"><a href="#1-Light-Control" class="headerlink" title="1. Light Control"></a>1. Light Control</h3><p>The first thing you’ll want to do to set up studio lighting in your home is to pick a room to film in and eliminate as much external lighting as you can. Use blinds, curtains, towels, or any thick fabric to block sunlight from shining into your room.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-3-Point-Lighting"><a href="#2-3-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. 3-Point Lighting"></a>2. 3-Point Lighting</h3><p>The most common setup for studio lighting is 3-point lighting. For this kind of lighting you’ll need three lights: a key light, a fill light, and a back light (also called a hair light).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-lighting-3-point-lighting.jpg"                      alt="3-Point Lighting"                ></p><p>Out of the three lights, the key light should be the brightest. When it is positioned to the left of you (as shown in the diagram above) your right side will have shadows.</p><p>To minimize the shadows on your right side, use a weaker light as a fill light. You don’t want your fill light to completely eliminate all your shadows or else your shot will look flat.</p><p>Lastly, a backlight positioned behind you can give an appealing highlight to the ends of your head and even help to separate your hair from blending into your background if both happen to be dark.</p><h3 id="3-4-Point-Lighting"><a href="#3-4-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="3. 4-Point Lighting"></a>3. 4-Point Lighting</h3><p>As a YouTuber, you may not only want yourself to be seen optimally with proper lighting, but you may also want your background to be seen optimally, especially if you’ve taken the time to decorate it for your audience.</p><p>What you’ll need to ensure that your background is sufficiently lit is 4-point lighting setup. The 4-point lighting setup is the same as a 3-point lighting setup, but with an additional light shining at your background.</p><p>For more information on lighting equipment, check out my <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-17-video-lighting-equipment-for-youtubers-440.html" >Top 17 Video Lighting Equipment For YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Touch-Up-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Touch-Up-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best video editing software for YouTube beginners to start the YouTube channel.

It provides statistics on our subscribers, views, and estimated revenue.</p><p>To start using Social Blade, type your channel name into the search bar.</p><p>On the top section of the page, several stats will be clearly displayed.</p><p>First, you will see the letter grade assigned to your channel by Social Blade. If it is not a very good one, keep in mind that channels with over 10, 000 might still only receive Cs. Only YouTube megastars are getting As and Bs.</p><p>Next to your grade are your subscriber and video view ranks, as well as a rank assigned to you by Social Blade.</p><p>On the second line, you will see the views and subscribers you got in the last 30 days and the percentage by which you are up or down. Simply searching for yourself and glancing at this line is the easiest way to see whether your channel is growing, even easier than in your YouTube Creator Studio.</p><p>The final line of the first section will show you an estimate of your monthly revenue.</p><p>If you scroll down to the second section you will be able to see your views, subscribers, and estimated earnings per day rather than per month. Growth is in green and loss is in red.</p><p>By looking at this chart you can see which videos benefited your channel most after they were posted (your videos are not listed, but you can see based on the day you posted them). This will give you a good idea of what your audience wants to see.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144289/7443" target="_top" id="2144289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144289/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Spying-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Spying-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Spying on Other Channels"></a>Spying on Other Channels</h2><p>When you check your stats, you type your channel name into the search bar.

But with no experience or training, it’s hard to know how to start a vlog and make money.</p><p>Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered!</p><p>This course shows you how to launch a profitable YouTube channel and monetize your new channel. You’ll learn everything you need to know, from finding your niche and the best ways to promote your vlog. Once your vlog starts getting views, you’ll see how to turn your viewers into subscribers, make money, and become a YouTube sensation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-1.jpg"                      alt="start vlog and make money"                ></p><p><strong>Background of vlogs on YouTube</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-2.jpg"                      alt="background of vlogs on youtube"                ></p><p>What started off as a way for vloggers to share their thoughts about topics they were passionate about eventually turned into a full-blown industry. According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.</p><p><strong>Why vlogs are loved by people</strong></p><p>Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.</p><p>But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">YouTube Ads</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Brand Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Affiliate Marketing</a></li><li><a href="#part3-4">Patreon</a></li><li><a href="#part3-5">Sell your service or products</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?</h2><p>So you’ve started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren’t you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let’s look at some common reasons why vloggers aren’t making any income and figure out how to get around them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043855/7443" target="_top" id="2043855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Who-is-my-target-audience"><a href="#Who-is-my-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Who is my target audience?"></a>Who is my target audience?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg"                      alt="target audience"                ></p><p>So, let’s be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098705/14409" target="_top" id="2098705">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098705" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098705/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112008/7443" target="_top" id="2112008">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112008" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112008/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today.

(what is a niche, and how to find)</h3><p>A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you’re passionate about and what you’re good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you’re offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.</p><h3 id="Consistency-and-patience"><a href="#Consistency-and-patience" class="headerlink" title="Consistency and patience"></a>Consistency and patience</h3><p>Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people’s interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><h3 id="Content-quality"><a href="#Content-quality" class="headerlink" title="Content quality"></a>Content quality</h3><p>With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it’s clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Ads"><a href="#YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112007/7443" target="_top" id="2112007">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112007" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112007/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services.
