It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

And, in this digitally oriented world, you’re left with no reason not to create a YouTube channel specifically when you have the right talent to use one. Well, this guide is for those who are already into YouTube video creation and now need help on how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong> as per different aspect ratios. According to YouTube’s aspect ratio, it’s the right place to move forward even if you want to resize your videos present on other social media apps. We know brands and other influencers generally practice this kind of social media marketing.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our session on resizing YouTube as per the ideal aspect ratio without further ado.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?</h2><p>For attracting more audience and increasing engagement on YouTube videos, you have to look at each factor, along with the YouTube video quality. And, you cannot overlook the size of YouTube video among these factors to make it your perfect shot among competitors. Considering the importance of such factors, we’ve come up with this specific section on introducing you to the correct aspect ratio for YouTube videos.</p><p>It’s crucial to know the size before you start the YouTube game!</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload videos of different sizes ranging from 240p to 8K. And, the dimensions for these different sizes are as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>240p:</strong> 426x240 pixels</li><li><strong>360p:</strong> 640x360 pixels</li><li><strong>480p:</strong> 854x480 pixels</li><li><strong>720p:</strong> 1280x720 pixels</li><li><strong>1080p:</strong> 1920x1080 pixels</li><li><strong>1440p:</strong> 2560x1440 pixels</li><li><strong>2160p:</strong> 3840x2160 pixels</li><li><strong>43200p:</strong> 7680×4320 pixels</li></ul><p>Along with these, the aspect ratio, video size, and length of YouTube video should also be taken into consideration while uploading YouTube videos.</p><p>Thus, the ideal aspect ratio to <strong>resize YouTube video</strong> is perfect as 16:9, which we’ll diversify in the following three sections.</p><p><strong>1. Computer</strong></p><p>On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.</p><p><strong>2. Android Phone</strong></p><p>In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size. The video will always fit the screen, whether it’s square, vertical, or horizontal. Ultimately, the videos will be shorter for widescreen and square for vertical.</p><p><strong>3. iPad &amp; iPhone</strong></p><p>Similarly, the YouTube app for iPad and iPhone automatically adjust the video size to fit the screen. Thus, every video will fit the screen, even if it’s square, horizontal, or vertical.</p><p>Before we let you know how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong>, here are some tips for creating awesome YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>Create a strategy for YouTube video beforehand.</li><li>Search for ideas and topics.</li><li>Understand the use of the best equipment and gear.</li><li>Ensure the best YouTube video editing.</li><li>Optimize YouTube videos.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac"></a>Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac</h2><p>Hopefully, you have noted the correct aspect ratio required for YouTube videos.

Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.</p><p>Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn’t require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.</p><hr><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 03:</strong> For creating a perfect thumbnail, select “Drone Free Camera” mode from the camera mode located on the bottom right corner of the screen. It will allow us to change the angle the way we want.

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

Both the young and the old throng on the internet for all sorts of information. Be it educational, promotional, research, entertainment, among many others. In fact, the recent hit by the COVID-19 pandemic saw learning institutions find help via internet learning. Therefore, more awareness surrounds the media platform, including websites and streaming services. YouTube is available for both learning and promotional events. The platform is easy to use and widely accessible by millions of viewers and promoters. But there is one driving force for promotors – to hit YouTube 1000 subscribers. Attaining this number comes with endless benefits, as this article explains.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/get-1k-youtube-subscriber-1.png"                      alt="get 1000 subscribers on youtube"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Why 1000 subscribers?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What will you get when you reach your 1000 subscribers’ milestone?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to get 1000 subscribers for your YouTube channel?</a></p><h2 id="Why-1000-subscribers"><a href="#Why-1000-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Why 1000 subscribers?"></a>Why 1000 subscribers?</h2><p>Subscribers hold a special place for your YouTube channel. They make it grow and spend more time watching than viewers who are not subscribed. You need 1,000 subscribers to monetize your channel. You’ll start earning as a creator and even apply for YouTube’s Partner Program. You can finally make money through ads, channel memberships, and subscriptions.</p><p>Here’s the kicker! As the channel owner, you’ll have more connections, and that means many viewers on the line. Of course, those who love what you do will tell their friends, and the channel goes on for more prospective subscribers and viewers. Nonetheless, you’ll get enormous people to engage in a conversation with. The fun will only go on if more viewers are on board. Remember, you want to garner as many peoples’ opinions as possible. So, the best platform for this is your channel. Eventually, you’ll sell your brand and continue to grow in your market niche.</p><h2 id="What-will-you-get-when-you-reach-your-1000-subscribers’-milestone"><a href="#What-will-you-get-when-you-reach-your-1000-subscribers’-milestone" class="headerlink" title="What will you get when you reach your 1000 subscribers’ milestone?"></a>What will you get when you reach your 1000 subscribers’ milestone?</h2><p>Every creator is relieved when they reach the 1k subscribers’ milestone. Expect lots of goodies in store for you.</p><h4 id="1-You-become-part-of-the-Opal-club"><a href="#1-You-become-part-of-the-Opal-club" class="headerlink" title="1) You become part of the Opal club"></a>1) You become part of the Opal club</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/get-1k-youtube-subscriber-2.png"                      alt="become part of the opal club"                ></p><p>It is good to feel honored as part of the Opal Club. This is a club reserved for creators whose channels have hit the 1,000 to 9,999 subscribers’ mark. And from the Opal Club, you get in-depth information on how to grow your community. Interacting with your viewers is a great avenue to escalate your channel.</p><p>It is also a quick way to get discovered. The Club will enlighten you on how to use metadata and collaborate to get more views.</p><h4 id="2-Easily-apply-for-YouTube-Partner-Program"><a href="#2-Easily-apply-for-YouTube-Partner-Program" class="headerlink" title="2) Easily apply for YouTube Partner Program"></a>2) Easily apply for YouTube Partner Program</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/get-1k-youtube-subscriber-3.png"                      alt="apply youtube partner program when you reach 1000 subscriber"                ></p><p>1,000 subscribers is a ticket for you to apply for YouTube Partner Program. However, you also need to get at least 4,000 hours of views from your subscribers. But being that you have reached the 1k mark, you can take other steps to gain the 4,000 hours of views. These could be keeping up with publishing your videos, linking your Google AdSense account, and many more.</p><h4 id="3-Some-congratulation-email-is-good-enough"><a href="#3-Some-congratulation-email-is-good-enough" class="headerlink" title="3) Some congratulation email is good enough"></a>3) Some congratulation email is good enough</h4><p>It feels good to get a pat on the back for a job well done! You’ll get a congratulatory email for your efforts. That would be a great motivation for you to even aim higher the mark. Likewise, your ranking will start escalating as compared to a content creator who hasn’t reached the 1,000-subscriber level.</p><h2 id="How-to-get-1000-subscribers-for-your-YouTube-channel"><a href="#How-to-get-1000-subscribers-for-your-YouTube-channel" class="headerlink" title="How to get 1000 subscribers for your YouTube channel?"></a>How to get 1000 subscribers for your YouTube channel?</h2><p>Now that you’ve seen what comes with 1K subscribers, our focus is to find ways to get to that number.</p><h4 id="1-Consider-your-audience-first-not-revenue"><a href="#1-Consider-your-audience-first-not-revenue" class="headerlink" title="1) Consider your audience first, not revenue"></a>1) Consider your audience first, not revenue</h4><p>Remember, it’s the audience that will help you generate revenue. So, if you are a new creator, think of what you can give to your audience instead of what you are getting. What is of value to your audience is more important as they’ll hang around your channel for passion. You can take advantage and tune your ideas to what most viewers like to get.</p><h4 id="2-Put-in-resources-to-encourage-subscriber-sign-ups"><a href="#2-Put-in-resources-to-encourage-subscriber-sign-ups" class="headerlink" title="2) Put in resources to encourage subscriber sign-ups"></a>2) Put in resources to encourage subscriber sign-ups</h4><p>Focus on getting traffic to your channel. There are several ways to encourage your viewers to subscribe, such as the use of animations on videos. It will not only attract their attention, but you’ll realize many viewers coming over. Several resources are available over the net. Just find what suits you best, or use several options to see which gig fetches the most clicks.</p><h4 id="3-Properly-advertise-your-videos"><a href="#3-Properly-advertise-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="3) Properly advertise your videos"></a>3) Properly advertise your videos</h4><p>The best way to get more users to subscribe to your channel is to engage them. Make the videos enticing such that when a user views one video, they end up clicking and viewing the next 5 or 10 of your other videos. Let it be enticing and corresponds to the topic of the moment.</p><h4 id="4-Add-a-good-channel-description"><a href="#4-Add-a-good-channel-description" class="headerlink" title="4) Add a good channel description"></a>4) Add a good channel description</h4><p>A viewer should know what your channel is all about just by a glance. And the best part to put emphasis on is the channel description. Let them know what you are offering and how it will be of benefit. More so, make it simple to understand so that they don’t waste time trying to figure out what your channel is about.</p><h4 id="5-Focus-on-YouTube-content-that-works"><a href="#5-Focus-on-YouTube-content-that-works" class="headerlink" title="5) Focus on YouTube content that works"></a>5) Focus on YouTube content that works</h4><p>Put double efforts into the content that works for you. Check out which videos perform better than others and add value to them. Sorting them by “most popular video” will help you organize your lines and perform much better while focusing on valuable stuff.</p><h4 id="6-A-call-to-action-is-good-enough"><a href="#6-A-call-to-action-is-good-enough" class="headerlink" title="6) A call to action is good enough"></a>6) A call to action is good enough</h4><p>Most creators forget this important part. After an introduction and putting up memorable videos, ensure you remind your viewers to subscribe to your channel. You can add a subscribe button to the end of the screen. It is even better to use graphics and animations to attract them to the action.</p><h4 id="7-Use-a-pinned-comment"><a href="#7-Use-a-pinned-comment" class="headerlink" title="7) Use a pinned comment"></a>7) Use a pinned comment</h4><p>Most viewers want to get answers to their questions or run to the comment section for more opinions. One tactic to gain more subscribers is to write a comment and pin it to your videos. Your pinned comment will appear at the top of the comment list, whereby everyone who has watched the video can’t miss coming across it. It is good, to be honest, and asking for them to subscribe is the best you can do after an engaging video shot.</p><h4 id="8-Add-value-to-other-channels"><a href="#8-Add-value-to-other-channels" class="headerlink" title="8) Add value to other channels"></a>8) Add value to other channels</h4><p>Don’t be selfish and want users to subscribe to your channel for nothing. Try to engage also in other people’s works and efforts. You can watch content that appeals to you and engage the community by creating a conversation. Find out what others like, and you might just attract a new subscriber to your channel so simply.</p><h4 id="9-Let-your-homepage-be-intuitive"><a href="#9-Let-your-homepage-be-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="9) Let your homepage be intuitive"></a>9) Let your homepage be intuitive</h4><p>Your homepage should be welcoming to both the tech gurus and beginners. Not all YouTube users have mastered the art of navigation on web pages or clicks. It is a good idea to use a channel trailer and a better description of what your channel does and how to reach important buttons. The homepage should not be crowded.

You have published your content and it’s not getting the views you had hoped.</p><p>Well, let’s change that!</p><p>In this guide, I’m going to walk you through YouTube SEO from the very start to the very end.</p><p>Nothing complicated. No paid programs or expensive apps needed. We are going back to basics and get your videos discovered.</p><p>Ready?</p><p>Let’s Go!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Research-Your-Topic-and-Competitors"><a href="#Part-1-Research-Your-Topic-and-Competitors" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Research Your Topic and Competitors"></a>Part 1: Research Your Topic and Competitors</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Come up with a video idea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Can’t come up with one? Let me help. I heard you can make a mean scrambled egg, why don’t you show the world how you do it?</p><p>Excellent! Let’s go with that idea.</p><p>Wait, don’t go making the video yet. First, we have to do some research. We need to know what videos already exist out there.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Find-Related-Videos"><a href="#Step-1-Find-Related-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Find Related Videos"></a>Step 1: Find Related Videos</h4><p>Do a quick search on YouTube to see what videos already exist on your topic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-related-videos.jpg"                      alt="Find Related Videos Sample"                ></p><p>Uh oh… your video will be competing against celebrities like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver.</p><p>Okay, don’t panic! There is a fantastic quote, credited to bestselling author, <a class="link"   href="https://acuff.me/" >Jon Acuff <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that goes:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fantastic-quote-do-not-compare-beginning-to-middle.jpg"                      alt="fantastic quote"                ></p><p>While researching your competition, you will feel overwhelmed, but remember, you are at the beginning, and Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver are not even at their middle, they are way passed the finish line. You still have a long journey to go, so don’t get discouraged, get inspired!</p><p>Watch those videos and understand what they are all about.</p><p>Understand that people watch YouTube for 3 key reasons:</p><p>- To be entertained</p><p>- To learn something new</p><p>- To be inspired</p><p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p><p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p><p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p><p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"                ></p><p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p><p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="Keywords in Ubersuggest"                ></p><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p><p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p><p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p><p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p><p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p><p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p><h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p><p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p><p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p><p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p><p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p><p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p><p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p><p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p><p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p><p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p><p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p><h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p><p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p><p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p><p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p><p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p><p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p><p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p><p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p><p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p><p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p><p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p><p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p><p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p><p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p><p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/encourage-viewers-to-engage-min.gif"                      alt="Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"                ></p><p>Who knows, who will respond.</p><h4 id="Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail"><a href="#Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Step 9: Design a Thumbnail"></a>Step 9: Design a Thumbnail</h4><p>You could have made a brilliant video, but if you have a poor quality thumbnail that is unattractive, then the overall performance of your video will suffer — and good SEO can only do so much after that.</p><p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"                ></p><p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p><p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p><p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or download <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful. These will help you get the job done as you are starting out.</p><p>Want to know more thumbnail maker?

You are almost there… but not there yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.filmora.io/5/XDyocwuGRiSptxueJZ5aokKqKt-JXMbX.gif"                      alt="XDyocwuGRiSptxueJZ5aokKqKt-JXMbX"                ></p><p>Come on, keep going!</p><h4 id="Step-10-Fill-Out-Your-Videos-Assets"><a href="#Step-10-Fill-Out-Your-Videos-Assets" class="headerlink" title="Step 10: Fill Out Your Videos Assets"></a>Step 10: Fill Out Your Videos Assets</h4><p>The video is done, the thumbnail is designed, and you have all your title, description, and tags ready to go. This step is easy, upload the video, and fill out the assets, and give yourself a pat on the back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creator-stuido-fill-out-video-assets.jpg"                      alt="Fill Out Your Videos Assets"                ></p><h4 id="Step-11-Add-Transcripts"><a href="#Step-11-Add-Transcripts" class="headerlink" title="Step 11: Add Transcripts"></a>Step 11: Add Transcripts</h4><p>In addition to making your content accessible for people who don’t want to or can’t listen to the audio in your video, adding subtitles and closed captions will help YouTube understand the spoken content in your video.</p><p>While YouTube does have an automatic subtitle generator, it’s not reliable enough to be used for identifying the keywords you use in your video.</p><p>You can choose to write out the whole transcript of your video yourself, but if you are press on time, which of course you are, you can simply go and edit the automatic transcript already available in your video. By the way, you can also use some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >automatic transcription software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist"><a href="#Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="Step 12: Add Video to Playlist"></a>Step 12: Add Video to Playlist</h4><p>Finally the last thing you need to do for your video is to add it to a playlist. Even though it might be the first video in the playlist, it helps YouTube identify your video if you organize it in a playlist.

It has ironical expressions that give the song its speciality. These songs are different when it comes to different singers or different artists. This is because every artist has their style and speciality which they include while composing their Parody songs. It can even be in the form of general style music.</p><p>Parody culture was first recognized in the 14th century and it has been named as one of the most artistically expressed devices.</p><p>There are various types of Parodies’,</p><ul><li>Film Parody</li><li>Poetic Parody</li><li>Self- Parody</li></ul><p>Parody is more frequently used when it comes to political announcements in the U.S.A.</p><p>Parody is in no way, shape or form fundamentally ironical, and may some of the time be finished with deference and energy about the subject in question, without being a remiss snide assault.</p><p>It is also used as a communicative dialogue bridge between cultures or at times subcultures.</p><p>Each endeavor at a Parody isn’t made similarly as a satire, and in each occurrence, the specific farce would need to experience the four-factor reasonable use examination to decide if it establishes a reasonable use.</p><p>In later occasions, the term melodic parody came to connote the hilarious utilization of new messages to previous vocal pieces, just as both genuine and amusing references to specific melodic styles</p><p> <strong>Top 10 Parody Songs:</strong></p><ul><li>Amish paradise</li></ul><p>“Weird Al” Yankovic has his style when it comes to composing Parody songs. He raps the everyday difficulties faced by people in a Humorous way. The thing which most caught my eye was the fact that the surroundings were made simple but the song has its way of making one crack up with laughter. Having around 4 decades of experience in Music Yankovic was one of the most famous composers of his time. People found it lucky to have their songs Parodied down by him.</p><ul><li>I gotta feeling- College Humour:</li></ul><p>Back in the days, this was one of the most popular Parody. It got a few dazzling feedbacks which made teenagers go crazy on the song. Its lyrics define how the frat parties at colleges end up with hangovers and some hazy memories of them logging out from the world. With his cell phones and a very few clues how a drunk guy figures out what happened the night of the party is what the whole song is about.</p><ul><li>White and Nerdy:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song. It revolves around the lines that a Man ‘can’t roll with the gangsters’ because he is too ‘White and Nerdy’.</p><p>This refers to all the Nerds out there who are more concerned about computer programs, Video games, Comics, Fancy dresses like superman or watching the Stars wars movies hundreds of times. This is one of the biggest hits of the century and was considered to be one of the funniest songs ever made.</p><ul><li>She was beautiful, I swear:</li></ul><p>The Parody by Kevin sage revolves around the topic that he sees a girl on a subway but how she turned out to be a man. It starts by him swearing that he thought she was a girl, but as you all guessed reality was something much more hilariously colourful. He was too drunk to differentiate between a man and a woman. But well, it is too late to face the truth, isn’t it?</p><ul><li>Look at this Instagram- College Humour:</li></ul><p>It revolves around how the social App Instagram is used. It is used to make other people jealous of how awesome your life. At least that is how Nickelback portrays it to be. The way her picture is so cute or the food she ate is delicious. The fact that her vacation at the beach was magnificent or the dress she bought was beautiful is how the whole song is written to be. Instagram users are made fun of in a harmless way about how they seem obsessed with their puppies or kittens.</p><ul><li>Tacky:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic describes the song about how tacky he is, or how he seems to eat food out of Instagram (Ironically of course). He talks about how he wears his sandals with socks or how he wears his belt with suspenders. It is a weirdly satisfying song.</p><ul><li>Fat:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song describes how fat a man is. He used Michael Jacksons song to make a Parody and this wasn’t the first time he did that. This video won the Grammy award for being the Best Concept Music Video ever. The video starts with a fat man walking and singing out all the problems he faces because of being fat.</p><ul><li>Telephone:</li></ul><p>A very famous and brilliant song. The video starts with the dialogue, “Will you tell me the concept of this telephone video or not’. This revolves around Lady Gaga. Maybe her weird costumes or her quirkiness.</p><ul><li>Gangnam style:</li></ul><p>Let’s face it, it is the most popular Parody which almost every citizen from the whole world had heard. Bark Baker has around 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube just because of this song. The most hilarious and also musically sound video which took over the entire industry with its massive hit.</p><ul><li>A complicated song:</li></ul><p>Another, massive hit by the famous “Weird Al,” Yankovic. This music video is divided into three parts. Each of them describing one of the weirdest situations the composer finds himself in. One revolves around too much pizza, the second one around the girl he loved but the fact that she was going to propose his cousin and the third one is about he almost knocked off this head while standing on a roller coaster ride.</p><p> Other famous Parody songs,</p><ul><li>Somebody that I used to know</li><li>Lose yourself</li><li>A lot</li><li>Friday</li><li>Poker face</li><li>Call me maybe</li><li>Hello</li><li>Beat it</li><li>Hooked on polkas</li><li>Boom Boom Pow</li><li>Party in the U.S.A</li><li>She’s always a woman</li><li>Best song ever</li><li>New rules</li><li>I’m a believer</li><li>All about that Bass</li><li>Tic Tok</li><li>Humble</li><li>I want a new Duck</li><li>Rehab</li><li>Blurred lines</li><li>Can’t feel my face</li></ul><p> Basics on how to make a Parody video:</p><p> Tips,</p><ul><li>Outline the structure of the song you want to write</li></ul><p>It is essential to pen down your ideas and structure it first instead of directly jumping to the finale. It can be done by putting down your primary theme at the top of the page and then penning the sub-themes. Try to simplify the meaning. Make note of all the important stuff.</p><ul><li>Try matching all the syllables</li></ul><p>Match the syllables of the Parody with the lyrics of the original composition. This is what gives the song its flavour. Start by counting the number of syllables in both the versions and try matching them as much as you can to give the same feel.</p><ul><li>Be active</li></ul><p>Don’t be lazy. Think and rethink all your ideas. Start looking for inspiration around you. Keep your mind active at all times. Who knows, something might strike you when you least expect it.</p><ul><li>Use the Thesaurus tool</li></ul><p>Make use of the internet and the tools it provides to beautify your work.</p><ul><li>Try speaking the words out loud</li></ul><p>Language can be confusing. Avoid that by speaking out loud before finalizing. This is found to be much more productive than just thinking about them in your mind.</p><ul><li>Edit and re-edit it</li></ul><p>Don’t ever submit the first draft. Edit it again and again and present the best version of it to the world.</p><ul><li>Refine the song at last</li></ul><p>Try talking about it with your family and ask them how it can be modified. Be open to suggestions and refine it as much as you can.</p><p> And voila, you have the best Parody music.</p><p> Conclusion:</p><p> A Parody is a work that is made by copying a current unique work to ridicule or remark on a part of the first. The most punctual realized spoof masses date from the late fourteenth century and the technique got basic in the fifteenth and sixteenth 100 of years. Parody, in music, initially the inventive adjusting of a few voice portions of a prior synthesis to frame another organization, as often as possible a mass; in present-day melodic use, spoof, as a rule, alludes to the comical impersonation of a genuine piece.</p><p>Spoofs can target VIPs, government officials, creators, a style or pattern, or some other intriguing subject.</p><p>Parody is significant because it permits us to condemn and address without being forceful or noxious. Or maybe, we use satire.</p><p>Few famous Parody singers, makers or Industries:</p><ul><li>Ellen DeGeneres</li><li>Weird Al Yankovic</li><li>College Humour</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-a-comparative-analysis-of-youtubes-ownership-vs-cc-licenses/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  A Comparative Analysis of Youtube's Ownership Vs.

While some of the creative tools might be expensive, the easy ones have a steep learning curve, and engaging a professional designer wouldn’t be something you might be ready for. <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is a great solution for any such situation.</p><p>With that being said, the following sections talk about what <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is, how is it useful, what advantages does it offer, and how can you create professional video adverts using the tool.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Get YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Tips for Making Good Video Ads with YouTube Video Builder</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>YouTube recently came up with an online tool, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong>, that, as the name suggests, enables you as an organization to prepare videos for free. These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and&#x2F;or products online.</p><p>However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> to prepare a video advertisement:</p><ul><li><strong>Logo</strong></li></ul><p>You must have a good-quality photo of your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >brand logo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.</p><ul><li><strong>HD Images</strong></li></ul><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.</p><ul><li><strong>Google Chrome Browser</strong></li></ul><p>You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Channel</strong></li></ul><p>Because <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Channel created <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability of the Tool and Features</strong></li></ul><p><strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer. However, this majorly depends on the region of your residence. As of now, the utility is not even available in some countries of the world.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Video-Builder-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Video-Builder-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?</h2><p>As explained earlier, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is an online tool that works on the latest version of the Google Chrome browser. The web interface of the utility has separate blocks (or placeholders if you want to call them) for different types of images. For instance, there is a placeholder for your logo, and a couple of other blank slots where you can import the photos from your computer.</p><p>There are some text input fields that you can populate with the relevant information such as the name of the video, the product’s name that you wish to promote, and many other things. There is a storyboard at the bottom of the interface that helps give your video a theme and the alignment of the ingredients that you have imported from your computer.</p><p>Finally, you can add background music to the video from the royalty-free tracks that can be accessed from the built-in library, and you are all set to go.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>Because YouTube Video Builder is in its Beta phase, at the time of this writing you are required to send an access request to Google using your account that you want to use to create the videos from. You can send your requests to: <a class="link"   href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/" >https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Once your request is approved, you can then use the same Google account to sign in to the <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> portal, and start preparing your video advertisements.

The following few tips would help you achieve this with ease:</p><ul><li>Make sure to gather all the ingredients such as the photos of the products, brand logo, etc. before starting with the video creation process</li><li>Set a layout, font, theme color, and background music that compliments the product(s) you wish to promote</li><li>Remain consistent with the theme color, fonts, etc. throughout the video</li><li>Make sure to include a catchy ‘Call for action’ text in your video ad</li><li>Make as many modifications as you want before publishing the ad on your YouTube Channel. Avoid doing any amendments after the ad has been posted</li><li>Share the link of your video with as many people as you possibly can to make your product(s) and brand visible and popular</li><li>Make sure to use the ad in your campaigns to make people aware of your brand&#x2F;product(s)</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The bitter truth is, producing videos, especially for brand promotions requires expert creators, expensive tools, and a good amount of work experience. Although all these can be managed if you have some spare funds, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> helps you create advertising videos of up to 15 seconds with ease and for free. All you need is access to <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong>, your own YouTube Channel, your brand logo, and high-definition photos of your product(s).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-mastering-engagement-a-compendium-of-the-top-20-youtube-hacks-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Engagement  A Compendium of the Top 20 YouTube Hacks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-diy-gif-creation-extracting-motion-from-youtube-videos/"><u>In 2024, DIY GIF Creation  Extracting Motion From YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-how-to-seamlessly-reorganize-video-playlists-on-yt/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Seamlessly Reorganize Video Playlists on YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/tune-youtube-video-pacing-desktopmobile-for-2024/"><u>Fine-Tune YouTube Video Pacing - Desktop/Mobile for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-connoisseurs-melding-visionary-sounds-and-frames/"><u>[Updated] Connoisseurs Melding Visionary Sounds & Frames</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-scripted-sign-offs-for-the-savvy-viewer/"><u>2024 Approved  Scripted Sign-Offs for the Savvy Viewer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-recovering-youtube-gems-2-easy-watch-methods-revealed/"><u>[Updated] Recovering Youtube Gems  2 Easy Watch Methods Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-strategic-monetization-for-game-streams/"><u>In 2024, Strategic Monetization for Game Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-unleashing-brand-potential-with-free-youtube-marketing-templates/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unleashing Brand Potential with FREE YouTube Marketing Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-elite-recording-software-to-handle-ultra-hd-screenshots/"><u>In 2024, Elite Recording Software to Handle Ultra HD Screenshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-change-lock-screen-wallpaper-on-nokia-g42-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Change Lock Screen Wallpaper on Nokia G42 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-unlocked-apple-iphone-14-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Everything You Need To Know About Unlocked Apple iPhone 14 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/pokemon-go-cooldown-chart-on-vivo-v30-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Vivo V30 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pixelprofessionalzoom7-expertly-scaling-your-photography/"><u>2024 Approved  PixelProfessionalZoom7  Expertly Scaling Your Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-bypass-expenses-relish-films-anywhere-free-player/"><u>[Updated] Bypass Expenses, Relish Films Anywhere (FREE Player)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/mastering-stardew-key-highlights-from-ginger-isle-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Stardew  Key Highlights From Ginger Isle for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-frolics-in-film-an-analytical-review-on-vhs/"><u>2024 Approved  'Frolics in Film'  An Analytical Review on VHS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elite-ai-companions-for-chat/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elite AI Companions for Chat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/will-the-ipogo-get-you-banned-and-how-to-solve-it-on-honor-x9a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Will the iPogo Get You Banned and How to Solve It On Honor X9a | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Camera shake is a huge distraction and, if it is a persistent problem in your YouTube videos, it will be hard to get subscribers. Shakiness is an easy problem to correct. With a bit of equipment, or a bit of creativity, it is easy to make sure your YouTube videos are nice and smooth.</p><h2 id="Best-Camera-Stabilizers-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Best-Camera-Stabilizers-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube"></a>Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube</h2><p> This article will talk about different types of equipment you can use to stabilize your camera. For vloggers on a budget, there is even one tip on stabilizing your camera without camera equipment. Here are some of the best stabilizers for YouTube videos:</p><h4 id="Part-1-Tripod"><a href="#Part-1-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Tripod"></a>Part 1. Tripod</h4><p> A tripod is a three-legged stand you can mount your camera to. The height of a tripod can be adjusted so you can set your camera up at the level that works best for you. Because tripods can stand alone you can set your camera up to record yourself without needing a helper.</p><p> Tripods are the best choice for vlogs that revolve around you standing (or sitting) and delivering information, like opinion or beauty vlogs.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Monopod"><a href="#Part-2-Monopod" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Monopod"></a>Part 2. Monopod</h4><p> A monopod is like a tripod in the sense that you can adjust its height, but unlike a tripod a monopod has only one leg and cannot stand by itself. You will need a helper to stay with your camera if you plan to film yourself using a monopod. A monopod is more portable than a tripod, though, and can be used in a wider variety of places. You can even use a monopod to record aerial shots just by picking it up.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Pistol-Grip"><a href="#Part-3-Pistol-Grip" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Pistol Grip"></a>Part 3. Pistol Grip</h4><p> A pistol grip is a handle you mount your camera to the top of. You can carry your camera around on top of the pistol grip, or you can mount the grip itself to your tripod or monopod. Once the grip is mounted you can use it to more easily control your camera movements. This is a great way to get even, steady, camera pans.</p><h4 id="Part-4-Selfie-Stick"><a href="#Part-4-Selfie-Stick" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Selfie Stick"></a>Part 4. Selfie Stick</h4><p> A selfie stick is a long pole you mount your smartphone to one end of in order to take selfies from farther away. Selfie sticks also make great stabilizers if you are shooting video on your smartphone. To stabilize your smartphone place the handle of your selfie stick on the ground as if it were a monopod. When you are shooting using a selfie stick you can also hold it up in the air to get interesting high angle shots.</p><p> Some YouTubers even like to shoot selfie-style vlogs where the hold the selfie stick just like they are taking a photo of themselves.</p><h4 id="Part-5-OIS-–-Optical-Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Part-5-OIS-–-Optical-Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization"></a>Part 5. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization</h4><p> ‘Optical Image Stabilization’ is fairly new hardware which is built in to a lot of new smartphones, like the iPhone 6S Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. OIS reduces camera shake by a lot, although it is still a good idea to stabilize your smartphone while you record. OIS will also help you take sharper still photos without using any software.</p><h4 id="Part-6-Tables-Desks-Trees-ect"><a href="#Part-6-Tables-Desks-Trees-ect" class="headerlink" title="Part 6. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect"></a>Part 6. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect</h4><p> If you do not have equipment, or cannot bring it where you want to shoot, then you can still record steady footage. You just have to get creative with where you put your camera. Any stable surface will do. You can set your camera down on a shelf in your house, a picnic bench, or up in a tree.</p><p> If you are able to lean your elbows onto a desk or table while you hold your camera then that will also significantly cut down on camera shake. This works best for footage you are not in, or which you can have a helper film for you. If you are open to shooting a selfie-style vlog then you can use anything you can rest your hand on, like a fence or a railing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-choreographing-narrative-news-wrappers/"><u>[Updated] Choreographing Narrative News Wrappers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-master-thumbnail-design-for-mac-users-youtube-edition-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Master Thumbnail Design for Mac Users - YouTube Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-viewer-payouts-for-video-engagement/"><u>In 2024, Viewer Payouts for Video Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/os-focused-techniques-downloading-and-saving-youtube-video-for-2024/"><u>[New] IOS-Focused Techniques  Downloading and Saving YouTube Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/urchase-pitfalls-steering-clear-from-the-seduction-of-false-subscribers-for-2024/"><u>[New] Purchase Pitfalls  Steering Clear From the Seduction of False Subscribers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-avoiding-the-blank-thumbnail-scenario-in-shorts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Avoiding the Blank Thumbnail Scenario in Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-deciphering-youtubes-monetary-mechanisms/"><u>2024 Approved  Deciphering YouTube's Monetary Mechanisms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ranscribe-without-breaking-the-bank-learn-how-with-our-free-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Transcribe Without Breaking the Bank  Learn How with Our Free Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-laughter-library-selecting-witty-content-for-short-youtube-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Laughter Library  Selecting Witty Content for Short YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-iphone-12-pro-max-passcode-easily-video-inside-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Bypass iPhone 12 Pro Max Passcode Easily Video Inside | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-s-leading-lego-stop-motion-studios-and-filmmakers/"><u>New 2024 Approved S Leading Lego Stop Motion Studios and Filmmakers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-use-jump-cuts-in-your-vlog-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-2022s-top-figure-skating-performances/"><u>In 2024, 2022'S Top Figure Skating Performances</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-views-to-revenue-simplifying-the-process-with-a-3-step-framework-for-monitoring-youtube-income/"><u>2024 Approved  From Views to Revenue  Simplifying the Process with a 3-Step Framework for Monitoring YouTube Income</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-instagrams-inconsistent-video-timings/"><u>[Updated] Navigating Instagram's Inconsistent Video Timings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-professional-shooters-guide-to-stability/"><u>[Updated] Professional Shooters' Guide to Stability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-creativity-producing-original-and-entertaining-reels-on-facebook/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlocking Creativity  Producing Original and Entertaining Reels on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-best-of-the-best-free-avi-video-rotation-software-for-2024/"><u>Updated Best of the Best Free AVI Video Rotation Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-sony-xperia-1-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Can I use iTools gpx file to catch the rare Pokemon On Sony Xperia 1 V | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
