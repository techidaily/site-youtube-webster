Choosing the best camera lens for your YouTube channel can be tricky because there are so many options. This article will walk you through some of them, and make two recommendations of great vlogging lenses. If you already have a good understanding of how camera lenses work then feel free to scroll down to the lens recs.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nyp7-xVwqHA?si=XCuZbpKLFIdrGQQh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-Lenses-Zoom-lens-Fixed-lens-aperture-f-stop"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-Lenses-Zoom-lens-Fixed-lens-aperture-f-stop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding Lenses: Zoom lens, Fixed lens, aperture, f-stop"></a>Part 1. Understanding Lenses: Zoom lens, Fixed lens, aperture, f-stop</h2><p>There are two main categories of camera lenses: ‘zoom’ – lenses that allow you to zoom in and out – and ‘fixed’. If your lenses are tools then zoom lenses are Swiss army knives; they are very versatile. Fixed lenses, also called prime lenses, have more specific purposes. Do you need a tool that can do a lot of things, or a tool that is perfect for one specific job? Sometimes it is useful to have access to both.</p><p>We have explained the differences between Fixed lens and Zoom lens and advantages of using each lens, check this article: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zoom Lens vs. Fixed Lenses: Which one is best for YouTuber? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for the detailed information.</p><p>Before we get into the recommendations here is a little background information on lenses in general:</p><h3 id="Beginner’s-Guide-to-Aperture-and-F-Stops"><a href="#Beginner’s-Guide-to-Aperture-and-F-Stops" class="headerlink" title="Beginner’s Guide to Aperture and F-Stops"></a>Beginner’s Guide to Aperture and F-Stops</h3><p>In order to be able to select the lens you’ll be using to record your YouTube videos, you first need to understand a few very basic concepts, such as aperture or f-stops.</p><h4 id="1-What-is-a-lens’s-aperture"><a href="#1-What-is-a-lens’s-aperture" class="headerlink" title="1.What is a lens’s aperture?"></a>1.What is a lens’s aperture?</h4><p>The aperture of your lens is the hole through which light reaches your camera’s sensor, or the film if you are using a film camera. The wider your aperture is the more light you are letting into your camera. In low light it is better to have a wide aperture, and when you are working with a lot of light it is better to have a narrow aperture so your footage is not overexposed.</p><p><strong>Aperture</strong> is simply an opening in the lens that lets the light through. If you want to increase the amount of the light that is reaching the camera’s sensor you need to open up the aperture blades that are located in the lens. The <strong>f-values</strong> like f&#x2F;1.2 or f&#x2F;1.8 indicate that the aperture is wide open and that the camera is receiving the maximum amount of light a lens you’re using can provide.</p><h4 id="2-What-is-an-‘f-stop’"><a href="#2-What-is-an-‘f-stop’" class="headerlink" title="2.What is an ‘f-stop’?"></a>2.What is an ‘f-stop’?</h4><p>Light passes through your lens’s aperture on its way to your camera’s sensor, and the f-stop of your lens relates to the amount of light it lets in. The lower your f-stop, the wider your aperture, and the more light you are letting into your camera. The more light you let into your camera the easier it is to achieve a blurred background. A lot of vloggers love blurring their backgrounds because it is a quick way to disguising the rooms they are shooting in.</p><p>F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.8’ or ‘f&#x2F;4’ on your lens. For more information on f-stops and blurring your background read “The Best Bokeh Lens - How to Get the Blurred Background for YouTube Videos” and watch Tasha’s video.</p><p><strong>F-stops</strong> or f-numbers indicate how open the aperture is, so for example if your camera is displaying f&#x2F;32 value it means that your camera is letting very little light to get through to the camera’s sensor. The f-number depends on a few other parameters such as shutter speed, exposure or ISO values. Large apertures provide a shallow depth of field which creates a smooth and artistic background blur, while a small aperture enables you to keep both the background and the foreground of your shot in focus.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odDOPrPjRYY?si=7QHzdUkTPNkHJiVj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Camera-Lenses"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Camera-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Types of Camera Lenses"></a>Part 2: Types of Camera Lenses</h2><p>The visual aspect of a video may not be the only thing you’ll have to dedicate special attention to while recording your YouTube video, but it is surely one of the most important factors of the video production process. A lens you are using will largely contribute to the aesthetics of the video. That’s why you need to know which type of lens will deliver the best results when shooting different types of scenes. Here are some of the most common types of lenses you’ll encounter.</p><h4 id="Standard-lenses"><a href="#Standard-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Standard lenses"></a>Standard lenses</h4><p>These lenses are featured in almost all camera kits, so the chances are that if you have a DSLR camera you already have a standard, mid-range lens. These lenses commonly have a fixed 50mm focal length, although zoom lenses with focal lengths in the range between 35mm and 75mm are also considered standard. You can use them to capture medium shots, single or multiple figure shots, and in some cases establishing shots, because they offer enough versatility to cover a multitude of different scenes. Standard lenses often have large apertures, which makes them quite useful if you often shoot videos under light conditions you can’t control.</p><h4 id="Macro-lenses"><a href="#Macro-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Macro lenses"></a>Macro lenses</h4><p>Details, product shots or any other subject that can be filmed from close proximity looks better if they are recorded with macro lenses. The high contrast and sharpness these lenses provide allow you to create stunning close-ups of all hosts, guests or actors in your YouTube videos. What’s more, if you are presenting a new product to your audience you can use the macro lens to make some captivating shots that will attract more audience. Zoom lenses can also be used for macro photography and video, although prime macro lenses produce better results.</p><h4 id="Telephoto-lenses"><a href="#Telephoto-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Telephoto lenses"></a>Telephoto lenses</h4><p>The subjects of your videos don’t always have to be in your immediate surroundings, because telephoto lenses let you capture scenes that are several miles away from you. Wildlife or sports videographers frequently use telephoto lenses because they don’t have another way of getting close to their subjects. However, telephoto lenses with 70-300mm focal length can also be used to take stunning portraits or close up shots. The biggest downside of telephoto lenses is their weight because the lenses with higher focal lengths can weigh up to 10lbs, which makes them a bit inconvenient to always carry with you.</p><h4 id="Wide-angle-lenses"><a href="#Wide-angle-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Wide-angle lenses"></a>Wide-angle lenses</h4><p>Recording videos of vast open spaces, breathtaking vistas or beautiful city views is much easier if you have a wide-angle lens. The short focal length allows the lens to have a wider field of view which covers more space than standard or telephoto lenses. Wide-angle lenses also have lower apertures than lenses with longer focal lengths which results in images that have a shallow depth of field. Ultra-wide lenses like fisheye distort the view so the videos recorded with these lenses often suffer from the lack of realism.</p><h4 id="Specialist-lenses"><a href="#Specialist-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Specialist lenses"></a>Specialist lenses</h4><p>YouTubers who are working on demanding projects can try to solve their troubles by using a specialist lens. Soft-focus lenses can help you take better portraits while tilt-shift lenses allow you to control the perspective. However, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which you’ll need a specialist lense if you are just starting out since even experienced videographers only use special lenses when they have absolutely no better way to record a scene.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Recommended-Best-Camera-Lenses-for-Shooting-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Recommended-Best-Camera-Lenses-for-Shooting-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Recommended Best Camera Lenses for Shooting YouTube Videos"></a>Part 3: Recommended Best Camera Lenses for Shooting YouTube Videos</h2><p>Here are a couple great lenses that might be good fits for you and your YouTube channel. The thing that makes them both ideal for vlogging is that they have low enough f-stops to blur out your background.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Camera Lens</th><th><strong>Type</strong></th><th><strong>Price</strong></th><th><strong>Aperture</strong></th><th><strong>Focal Length</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Canon EF-S 10-18mm f&#x2F;4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens</strong></td><td>Wide angle</td><td>$279</td><td>f&#x2F;4.5-5.6</td><td>10 -18mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rokinon 8mm f&#x2F;3.5</strong></td><td>Fisheye</td><td>$249</td><td>f&#x2F;3.5</td><td>8mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Canon 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM Lens</strong></td><td>Prime</td><td>$125</td><td>f&#x2F;1.8</td><td>50mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Canon EF 135mm f&#x2F;2L USM Lens</strong></td><td>Telephoto</td><td>$999</td><td>f&#x2F;2</td><td>135mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f&#x2F;2.8</strong></td><td>Standard Zoom</td><td>$299</td><td>f&#x2F;2.8</td><td>17 -50mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sony 30mm f&#x2F;3.5 Macro</strong></td><td>Macro</td><td>$278</td><td>f&#x2F;3.5</td><td>30mm</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="1-Canon-EF-S-10-18mm-f-4-5-5-6-IS-STM-Lens"><a href="#1-Canon-EF-S-10-18mm-f-4-5-5-6-IS-STM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="1.Canon EF-S 10-18mm f&#x2F;4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-10-18mm-4-5-5-6-Lens/dp/B00K899B9Y/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439039090&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+10-18mm+f/4.5-5.6&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=81cf63202a546809712746fdac765188&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.L" >Canon EF-S 10-18mm f&#x2F;4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Canon released this lens in 2014 and shortly after it has gained the reputation of one of the most reliable wide to <strong>ultra-wide lenses</strong> for Canon cameras. Like most STM lenses, it offers incredibly <strong>fast autofocus technology</strong> that makes it a great choice for fast-paced action videos. The lens is equipped with an <strong>image stabilization system</strong> which guarantees that your videos are going to remain <strong>sharp</strong> even if the camera wasn’t perfectly still while you were recording. Somewhat smaller aperture range makes this lens <strong>poor choice for low light scenes</strong>, although you can get decent results if you manage to keep the camera still.</p><h4 id="2-Rokinon-8mm-Ultra-Wide-f-3-5-Fisheye-Lens"><a href="#2-Rokinon-8mm-Ultra-Wide-f-3-5-Fisheye-Lens" class="headerlink" title="2.

Rokinon 8mm lens allows you to <strong>adjust focus and aperture manually</strong> so you can fine-tune your shot before hitting the record button. To make things even better this model is <strong>compatible with a wide range of cameras including Pentax, Canon or Nikon DSLRs.</strong> It has a relatively <strong>fast aperture</strong> that enables it to deliver <strong>solid performances under low light conditions</strong>.</p><h4 id="3-Canon-EF-50mm-f-1-8-STM-Lens"><a href="#3-Canon-EF-50mm-f-1-8-STM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="3.Canon EF 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM Lens"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-STM-Lens/dp/B00X8MRBCW/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=cd09588b67ac10e4e960ea45c87b3f06&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slotNum=4" >Canon EF 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM Lens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec01.JPG"                      alt="camera lens"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qbuund2HKOQ?si=NaGHqIrx8hSL7gWV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The EF 50mm is a fixed lens with an f-stop of 1.8, which means it is great for blurring your background and performs well even in poorer lighting conditions. This is a really great lens for an opinion or beauty vlog, where you do not need to move around. You can stay put right where the focus is sharpest and stand out by blurring everything behind you. If you tend to reuse the same sets then you do not really need a zoom feature. If your shooting conditions rarely change then it is just as easy to use a reliable fixed lens like the EF 50mm since you will not need to be rethinking your set up and adjusting.</p><p>If you are looking for an inexpensive prime lens that lets you create sharp videos with shallow depth of field, you should look no further. This model is one of three Canon’s 50mm prime lenses, although the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Standard-Medium-Telephoto-Cameras/dp/B00009XVCZ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-3&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=11bff1019e73f0462c30a04e98d4874f&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTe" >50mm f&#x2F;1.4 USM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-Lens-Digital-Cameras/dp/B000I1YIDQ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-4&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=d77bb813550f12e8aa72c8738dfaad81&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slot" >50mm f&#x2F;1.2 ‘L’ USM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> models are much more expensive. You can use it to record a lot of different types of YouTube videos, like product reviews or makeup tutorials. The 50 mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM lens doesn’t have image stabilization technology so you should try to be as still as you can possibly be when shooting handheld videos in order to avoid recording footage that has a lot of camera shakes.</p><h4 id="4-Canon-EF-135mm-f-2L-USM-Lens"><a href="#4-Canon-EF-135mm-f-2L-USM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="4.Canon EF 135mm f&#x2F;2L USM Lens"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-135mm-USM-Lens-Cameras/dp/B000053HC5/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439038618&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+EF+135mm+f/2+L+USM+Lens&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=3ef39fe6c476b0dab7cf573810e16103&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoY" >Canon EF 135mm f&#x2F;2L USM Lens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Recording <strong>moving objects</strong> from a distance requires you to have a lens that allows you to smoothly track their movements while keeping the subject in focus. The Canon EF 135mm f2&#x2F;L USM lens is perhaps one of the best telephoto lenses on the market because it uses L glass that is widely accepted as the best in the industry. The Canon’s telephoto lens is compatible with ASP-C and Full Frame EF mount cameras. Keep in mind that this is also a prime lens and you can’t increase or decrease its focal length, but even so, it is a perfect choice for documentary-style videos.</p><h4 id="5-Tamron-SP-AF-17-50mm-f-2-8-XR-Di-II-LD-Aspherical-IF-Lens"><a href="#5-Tamron-SP-AF-17-50mm-f-2-8-XR-Di-II-LD-Aspherical-IF-Lens" class="headerlink" title="5.Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f&#x2F;2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens"></a>5.<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Tamron-17-50mm-Aspherical-Canon-Cameras/dp/B000FZ3FY8" >Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f&#x2F;2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec02.JPG"                      alt="camera lens rec02"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PD0vq5qAYkw?si=5H3KWtCfUOYg1Nlv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The Tamron’s standard zoom lens offers good value at a very reasonable price. The maximum aperture is f&#x2F;2.8, while the minimum aperture value this lens supports is f&#x2F;32, which means that its users can easily experiment with different <strong>depths of field.</strong> The lens is <strong>compatible with most Canon cameras</strong> so if you have a camera from another manufacturer you may have to use the lens adapter in order to mount it onto your camera. Like most standard zoom lenses, Tamron SP AF model is <strong>highly versatile</strong> and you can use it to record <strong>a wide range of different scenes</strong>.</p><p>A lot of zoom lenses do not have wide enough apertures to create blurred backgrounds, but this Tamron lens is an exception at f&#x2F;2.8. This low f-stop also means that it performs better in poor lighting conditions than a lot of other zoom lenses. If your shooting conditions change a lot – if you often change locations, for example – then it will be good to have a sturdy, well-built, zoom lens like the AF 17-mm that can be quickly adapted to new angles and distances.</p><h4 id="6-Sony-30mm-f-3-5-Macro"><a href="#6-Sony-30mm-f-3-5-Macro" class="headerlink" title="6.Sony 30mm f&#x2F;3.5 Macro"></a>6.<a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/791322-REG/Sony%5FSEL30M35%5F30mm%5Ff%5F3%5F5%5FWide%5FAngle%5FLens.html" >Sony 30mm f&#x2F;3.5 Macro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>All Sony’s APS-C format E mount cameras are compatible with this multi-purpose lens. When mounted the 30mm lens provides a 45mm focal length equivalent, which means that you can use it to take macro shots of products or to record medium or close-up shots. This is a prime lens, so changing the focal length isn’t really an option, but the 1:1 life-size magnification, as well as the 0.9-inch working distance, allow you to get close to the subjects in the video. The aperture range is between f&#x2F;3.5 and f&#x2F;22 which means that you can choose how shallow the depth of field in your shot should be.</p><p>If you are using a 4k camera to shoot your YouTube video, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best camera lens for 4k professional production. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/620kcQ7Dw7w?si=a5ussGs5HV7sG3hF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-effortless-fb-stream-setup-using-obs-on-laptops-mac-and-pc/"><u>[New] Effortless FB Stream Setup Using OBS on Laptops, Mac & PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-best-cameras-for-vlogging/"><u>[New] In 2024, Best Cameras for Vlogging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-ideal-outlet-where-to-post-your-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ideal Outlet Where to Post Your Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/erfecting-the-pulse-news-outro-techniques/"><u>[New] Perfecting the Pulse News Outro Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/eamless-content-propagation-beyond-youtube-and-facebook-for-2024/"><u>[New] Seamless Content Propagation Beyond YouTube and Facebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ap-into-endless-visual-archives-from-top-4-video-platforms/"><u>[New] Tap Into Endless Visual Archives From Top 4 Video Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-digital-dome-streamlining-your-song-posts-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Digital Dome Streamlining Your Song Posts on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-hands-on-techniques-for-storing-vimeo-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Hands-On Techniques for Storing Vimeo Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-iphone-zoom-videography-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] IPhone Zoom Videography for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-connectivity-at-its-peak-mastering-real-time-social-broadcasts/"><u>2024 Approved Connectivity at Its Peak Mastering Real-Time Social Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/fixing-msvcr71dll-errors-effective-strategies-and-tips-for-windows-users/"><u>Fixing MSVCR71.dll Errors: Effective Strategies and Tips for Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/est-8-free-editing-programs-to-streamline-your-youtube-projects/"><u>The Best 8 Free Editing Programs to Streamline Your YouTube Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-12-prominent-honor-magic-6-lite-fingerprint-not-working-solutions-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 12 Prominent Honor Magic 6 Lite Fingerprint Not Working Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/unlock-your-xiaomi-civi-3-phone-with-ease-the-3-best-lock-screen-removal-tools-by-drfone-android/"><u>Unlock Your Xiaomi Civi 3 Phone with Ease The 3 Best Lock Screen Removal Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/be-rankings-secrets-enhancing-video-visibility/"><u>YouTube Rankings Secrets Enhancing Video Visibility</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

So if you are a cooking aficionado, you have excellent potential to gain positive attention and a loyal audience. But to create engaging videos, you’d need a lot more than excellent culinary skills. This article aims to enlighten aspiring food and recipe vloggers about the essentials of video making straight out of the oven, to create enriched content that’s professional, neat, and viral-worthy.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Tips to Make Your Cooking Videos Stand Out</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Promote Your Cooking Channel on YouTube?</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cBCyRXC1-Tw?si=lN9P2xo0hsfyD8K6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Prepare-Before-Making-a-Recipe-Video"><a href="#What-to-Prepare-Before-Making-a-Recipe-Video" class="headerlink" title="What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video"></a>What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video</h2><p>While you would know best about the prep work needed for the recipes, the prep work for making a video starts with a plan. What goes into the plan?</p><p>Brainstorm this equation - <strong>Main Content + Duration + Light + Sound + Camera + Camera Angle, Shots &amp; Transition</strong>.</p><p><strong>The main content is how you picture the finished video</strong>. Ask yourself - Do you want an intro gig? Are you going to talk in the video or show only hands and the cooking with a piece of background music? How do you wish to present the ingredients? Would there be additional tips? At what platform are you going to publish your content? How long should be your clippings? Consider all these questions to chalk out a basic framework of your video</p><p><strong>The camera is a pivotal element</strong>. Whether it is a smartphone or a hi-fidelity digital camera, it is worthwhile to familiarise the best positions and light orientations and the capacity of the device to produce the best quality picture.</p><p><strong>How is your sound going to be like?</strong> If you are going to talk in the video, it is recommended that you use a microphone. Or else, you can also use background sound. But to mix sound with the video, you’d need an excellent sound editing tool.</p><p>Finally, comes the editing and finishing part. Eventually, you’ll need purposive video-editing software to help you work out the video transitions, sound, and visual effects.<strong>Choose a toolkit that is easy to learn</strong> and that you can get comfortable with so that the job of video editing doesn’t take the focus away from the main task of cooking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recipe-videos.jpg"                      alt="Recipe Videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pGHmqD53gc8?si=ymgHIB6Aa7_MoUUf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now, once you have all the essential ingredients to create your video, start practicing. Remember that it is the most natural thing for the first videos to appear amateurish or inept. And that is part of the plan. Don’t be disheartened and keep going.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLlUft1ZxI0?si=pBd5QdHEE27qsNlN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Make-a-Cooking-Video-with-Filmora-a-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Make-a-Cooking-Video-with-Filmora-a-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide"></a>Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>As one of the easiest-to-use video editing tools, the full-featured Filmora is the right choice considering it can fit most of your needs. Moreover, you’d be delighted to know that the software also has a series of features and functions and even tutorial videos dedicated to cooking videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pSRlspzW-A?si=A82G3Yxwj_31cKDq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Step-1-Filming-the-Video"><a href="#Step-1-Filming-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Filming the Video"></a>Step 1: Filming the Video</h4><p>Whether you are going to present a traditional cook-with-me style video or feature the contemporary “jump-cut” style focusing on speedy short videos, you need to prepare all the equipment and ingredients to suit the frame by frame shots. Consider spills, drops, overcooking, etc. as part of the process, so keep adequate substitutes to continue with your project unwaveringly. If you are using a phone, keep it fully charged up. And have a plan beforehand about what you should do when you get an urgent call while shooting. Also, consider doing a site investigation of the shooting spot for any fragile items, pointy corners, slippery areas, curious pets, etc. to avoid trips and falls in the middle of the filming, especially when working with a cameraman who’s following your movement. If you are using a tripod, and floor-standing lights, remember to secure the equipment with plenty of adhesive tapes, lest they bump into an expensive trip or fall.</p><h4 id="Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora"><a href="#Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora"></a>Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora</h4><p>You need to sync the device that you used to film the video with the computer that has Filmora installed. It may be a phone or a camcorder. Once the devices are synced, you should launch the Filmora software and go the <strong>“Media”</strong> button at the top right toolbar. There you will find the <strong>“Import”</strong> button. You will get a pop-up message asking you to choose the type of device. Select the right one, and your video will be imported in the Filmora interface.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion"></a>Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion</h4><p>To create crisp, fast-paced videos, you don’t have to gobble up the content eyeing at the duration. Think smart when you have the resources of a tool like Filmora. Here are the three best features that help you create fast-paced yet well-defined recipes.</p><p><strong>Time-Lapse:</strong> The time-lapse feature allows you to adjust the speed of the video from slow-motion to 10x faster. To use this, double click on a specific clip in your imported video and open the custom speed settings. Use the adjusting meter beside speed to make your clip as fast or slow as you want. You may use the same feature to introduce the slow-motion effects in certain areas of the video.</p><p>Now, when you are using either the fast-forward or slow-motion effects, it is best to have stable video footage with consistent lighting and a static background. There are also the options of Reverse Speed that can play the clip backward, as in flash-back. The Ripple edit feature allows you to cut short a long clip seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Jump Cut:</strong> The Jump Cut is about snipping unwanted areas in the clip. It may sound like the Ripple edit mentioned above, but the ripple edit is more functional for cutting short a continuous video so that the viewer won’t realize the snip. For the Jump Cut, it doesn’t have to be a constant clip. You can get to the next frame or scene with an abracadabra move.</p><p>To use Jump Cut, place the cursor over the starting of the clip that you want to cut, and right-click on it and select <strong>“Split”</strong> (the <strong>“scissors”</strong> feature on the toolbar does the same thing). To make this look neat, preview the portion of the clip once again and delete the cuts between two clips with the same right-click.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora"><a href="#Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora"></a>Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora</h4><p>Transitions make your video more interactive and help you segregate the video from frame-to-frame with effects like dissolve, fade, flash, etc. there are numerous transition options available within the Filmora suit.</p><p>The best way to do this drag and drop the clips on the timeline is to trim parts of the clip to shorten it. Once you have all the clips in place, go to the <strong>“Transitions”</strong> options at the top toolbar to apply it on the end or start of each clip.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Audio-Playback-Sound-Edits"><a href="#Step-5-Audio-Playback-Sound-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Audio, Playback &amp; Sound Edits"></a>Step 5: Audio, Playback &amp; Sound Edits</h4><p>There are plenty of options that you can remove background noise, add voiceover, add music, and detach audio from video. Refer to the Audios section from your toolbar.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Save-to-Drive-Emport-Publish"><a href="#Step-6-Save-to-Drive-Emport-Publish" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Save to Drive&#x2F; Emport&#x2F; Publish"></a>Step 6: Save to Drive&#x2F; Emport&#x2F; Publish</h4><p>Once you are satisfied with your content, then go to Export. Choose the format of the video, MOV, MP4, MPG, etc. and whether you wish to publish directly or save to drive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nWu29cqFjZA?si=TNZyCbPq68PQ0JIb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-to-Make-Your-Cooking-Videos-Stand-Out"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Your-Cooking-Videos-Stand-Out" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Your Cooking Videos Stand Out"></a>Tips to Make Your Cooking Videos Stand Out</h2><ul><li>Lighting is your best friend.

YouTube vlogging is valued for consistency. If you have a list of 10, 15, 20 videos, then you can have enough time in hand to film your next videos.</li><li>Have a consistent style to create brand recognition. Do you think branding is not for Vlogs? Well, I suppose you might be wrong. Branding is for anyone who uses it.</li><li>Share the link of your YouTube videos on other platforms like Twitter and Facebook.</li><li>Encourage your viewers to comment on the video.</li><li>Explore the different YouTube SEO strategies and use the accurate keywords in your video descriptions with hashtags.</li></ul><p>With prior planning and practicing, you are bent on developing more confident moves and camera angles.

Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> drop-down menu and select the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the <strong>Media tab</strong>, and you can just <strong>drag and drop</strong> it to a video track on the timeline.</p><p>All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag <strong>one of its ends to the left or to the right</strong>. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display <strong>the remaining footage</strong> while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to <strong>extend the file by dragging it</strong> until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool"></a>Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool</h4><p>Filmora’s <strong>Split tool</strong> can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply <strong>place the playhead</strong> at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make <strong>a cut</strong>, and click on the <strong>Split icon</strong> that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the <strong>Delete</strong> button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Scene Detection"></a>Method 3: Using Scene Detection</h4><p>Wondershare’s video editor also offers an <strong>automatic way to split a video</strong> clip into a number of separate scenes. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the <strong>Scene Detection</strong> option from the menu and proceed to click on the <strong>Detect button</strong>, after the <strong>Scene Detection window</strong> pops up on the screen. The software will then <strong>automatically analyze the footage</strong> and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the <strong>Add to Timeline button</strong> once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection-interface.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Scene Detection Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool"></a>Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool</h4><p>The <strong>Instant Cutter Tool</strong> enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora. Select the <strong>Import with Instant Cutter Tool option</strong> from the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and wait for the <strong>Filmora Instant Cutter</strong> window to appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see <strong>Trim and Merge tabs</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>Trim tab</strong> is selected and then click on the <strong>Open File button</strong> to import a video clip you’d like to trim. You can then use <strong>the trimming sliders</strong> to designate the parts of the video you’d like to remove or the set the <strong>In and Out points</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Set In Point or Set Out Point icons</strong>. Click on the <strong>Export button</strong> to save the new version of the video clip and <strong>click OK</strong> to complete the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instant-cutter-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Instant Cutter Tool"                ></p><h2 id="Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos"></a>Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos</h2><p>In case you’re looking for a tool that lets you save extracts of scenes from YouTube to your computer free of charge <a class="link"   href="https://ytcutter.com/" >YT Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may be one of your best options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yt-cutter-youtube-trimmer.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos online "                ></p><p>This online video editing platform is remarkably easy to use since you just have to <strong>copy</strong> <strong>the link to the YouTube video</strong> you’d like to trim into <strong>YT Cutter’s URL box</strong> and then select how long the new video should be.

In 2019, it was held in Tokyo, Japan, but back in 2016, 2017 and 2018, it was held in New York City. This article just introduced the YouTube Creator Summit in 2017.</p><p>Tons of big-name creators were flown out by YouTube for a week of activities, networking opportunities, interesting speakers, and unicorn petting zoos. We assume.</p><ul><li><a href="#dumbo"><strong>A map of Dumbo</strong></a></li><li><a href="#postcards"><strong>Post Cards</strong></a></li><li><a href="#bottle"><strong>S’well bottle</strong></a></li><li><a href="#slippers"><strong>Branded slippers</strong></a></li><li><a href="#pins"><strong>Pins, pins, pins</strong></a></li><li><a href="#jacket"><strong>Denim jacket</strong></a></li></ul><p><em>Lilly’s Creator Summit adventures.</em></p><p>The Creator Summit is invite-only, and only 120 YouTubers attended including Grace Helbig, Lilly Singh, Matthew Santoro, Eva Gutowski, Jon Cozart, and Hannah Hart. We can really only imagine what went on based on what some YouTubers chose to share with us over social media. That’s how we know there were appearances from off-YouTube celebrities too, like Will Smith and Riz Ahmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-2017.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Summit Group Photo"                ></p><p><em>Will Smith was one of the speakers at the summit.

Here’s what was in the box:</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-A-map-of-Dumbo"><a href="#1-A-map-of-Dumbo" class="headerlink" title="1. A map of Dumbo"></a>1. A map of Dumbo</h2><p>The hotel YouTube put the creators up in was in Dumbo, Brooklyn. ‘Dumbo’ is an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. While it used to be primarily an industrial area, Dumbo is now the most expensive neighborhood in Brooklyn with many of the old industrial spaces now serving as luxury residential lofts. Dumbo is also a hub for tech startups.</p><p><em>Tess takes you to some of her favorite places in Dumbo.</em></p><p>Dumbo is home to an interesting mix of ‘past’ and ‘future’. The creators who attended the summit probably had a lot of fun exploring it.</p><h2 id="2-Post-Cards"><a href="#2-Post-Cards" class="headerlink" title="2. Post Cards"></a>2. Post Cards</h2><p>One of the major benefits of attending this summit would have been networking with other creators, but because of how busy everyone was and how awkward it can be to arrange ‘bumping into’ someone YouTube created a way for creators to send each other notes. All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event. YouTube took care of making sure the person it was addressed to got it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_dOmuXhsV6Y?si=aT6vgPbDx4ajjvdr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-S’well-bottle"><a href="#3-S’well-bottle" class="headerlink" title="3.

YouTubers invited to the Creator Summit received ones with YouTube branding on them. A good water bottle is a convention&#x2F;conference essential, so this was a very practical gift.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43goO8X0iX0?si=48Cqf6td2q_6T6h3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Branded-slippers"><a href="#4-Branded-slippers" class="headerlink" title="4.

Plus, now every time these YouTubers look down at their feet they’ll be reminded to go make some videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-branded-slippers.jpg"                      alt="Branded slippers - 2017 YouTube Creator Summit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yZKNLxj3po?si=-RbF6nCJEVlHWP-M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>thinknoodles wearing his YouTube slippers.</em></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpnYKIrpgZQ?si=94zicAHp1CH-0oso" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Pins-pins-pins"><a href="#5-Pins-pins-pins" class="headerlink" title="5.

Aside from a complementary Brooklyn and 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge (the hotel the creators were staying at) pins, the creators did not receive these in their swag boxes – they had to collect them.</p><h2 id="6-Denim-jacket"><a href="#6-Denim-jacket" class="headerlink" title="6.

It is a header image displayed at the top of your channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-banner-size.jpg"                      alt="youtube video size"                ></p><p> For each kind of display (mobile, desktop, and TV), channel art (or banner) dimension changes accordingly.</p><p> Either your cover photo or your YouTube banner is displayed at the top of the channel so it’s highly significant to consider what you are depicting about your channel through these images.</p><p> Hence, this being said or realized, selecting the appropriate banner resolution should be among your topmost priorities.</p><p> The recommended banner dimensions of a YouTube video as suggested by YouTube are 2560 x 1440 pixels. But the dimensions may slightly vary with the variation in the devices being used by the users.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Displays</th><th>Banner image Dimensions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Video display</td><td>2560 x 1440 pixels</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop display</td><td>2560 x 423 pixels</td></tr><tr><td>Tablet display</td><td>1855 x 423 pixels</td></tr><tr><td>Television</td><td>2560 x 1440 pixels</td></tr></tbody></table><p> For a thorough understanding, refer to the image below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-banner-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="best video format for youtube"                ></p><p> Image from learn.g2</p><h4 id="The-right-cover-photo-size-on-TV"><a href="#The-right-cover-photo-size-on-TV" class="headerlink" title="The right cover photo size on TV"></a>The right cover photo size on TV</h4><p> The image displayed when accessing YouTube from TV will appear and be uploaded full or maximized.

It entails how exactly the bits are used while encoding the information in a digital storage medium.</p><p> So, a video file format is basically a type of file format in order to store the digital data of a video in the computer system. Mostly, video is often stored using the lossy compression in order to reduce the file size.</p><p><strong>Frame Rate</strong></p><p> “Frame rate” essentially entails the frequency (rate) at which the simultaneous images display on the screen. These images or called “frames”. Frame rate is expressed in “frames per second or FPS”. The unit or term is applicable for film, cameras, motion capture, video, and computer graphics. This is also known as “frame frequency”, expressed in the unit “hertz”</p><p><strong>Resolution</strong></p><p> Resolution is a measure to entail the clarity and sharpness of an image and most often used as a metric to judge the quality of cameras, monitors, printers, etc.</p><p> It basically refers to the number of different pixels in each dimension which can be viewed in any display device.</p><p><strong>File Size</strong></p><p> File size refers to the space that a file occupies in a storage medium, like hard drive or USB. The measure of file sizes can be expressed in bytes (B), kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB), and so on.</p><p> As shown in the picture below, the files listed in the <a class="link"   href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/explorer.htm" >Windows Explorer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> assorted as per the file with the largest size first. The file with the name “family-safety.jpg” occupies the largest size of 47 KB and the smallest one with 32 KB size.</p><p><strong>Codec</strong></p><p> Codec is a device or maybe a computer program that is used to encode or decode a stream of digital data or signal. A codec is a short form of “coder-decoder”.</p><p> The basic function of a coder is to encode the stream of data or signal for storage or transmission, usually in an encrypted form.</p><p> While, a decoder decodes the encoded (possibly encrypted) data, which is merely a reverse process of a coder. The application of codec are in streaming media, videoconferencing, and video editing applications.</p><p><strong>Aspect ratio:</strong></p><p> This term refers to the proportion of your video. In other words, the video aspect ratio can be defined as the width or breadth (of an image or screen) with respect to its height. Such a ratio can be expressed or represented in the form of “width x height.</p><p> That means an aspect ratio of 4x3 refers to an image that is 4 units wide and 3 units high. Similarly, it can also be expressed with a colon in between the units such as 4:3 or 16:9.</p><p><strong>Need a YouTube support?</strong></p><p> If you need any support, guidance or may face any queries related to anything regarding your YouTube channel, here’s the link of <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/?hl=en#topic=9257498" >YouTube support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p> Hopefully, with this detailed guide, you are now ready to make a wise decision regarding customizing your videos and channel as per viewers likeliness.

You’ve probably heard that before – viewers might forgive sub-par video quality if they’re interested in what you’re saying, but if it’s hard to understand what you’re saying they’ll click away.</p><p>Getting an external mic (even a <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Seacue-Omnidirectional-Condenser-Smartphones/dp/B0727Z8TMX/ref=sr%5F1%5F5?ie=UTF8&qid=1504204000&sr=8-5&keywords=lav+mic" >$10 one-off Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>) is one of the best ways to improve your videos. That said, maybe your budget is $0. Or, maybe you just don’t happen to have a mic now and don’t want to wait to make videos. It could even be that you just don’t want to bother with an external mic.</p><p>Luckily, there are a lot of easy, free, things you can do to protect the quality of your audio recording even if you’re not using an external mic. Here are a few tips:</p><ul><li><a href="#close">1. Keep Your Camera Close</a></li><li><a href="#quiet">2. Shoot Somewhere Quiet</a></li><li><a href="#room">3. Pick a Good Room</a></li><li><a href="#wind">4. Protect your Built-In Mic from Wind</a></li><li><a href="#app">5. Use a Free Audio App</a></li><li><a href="#check">6. Do a Sound Check</a></li></ul><h2 id="1-Keep-Your-Camera-Close-like-really-close"><a href="#1-Keep-Your-Camera-Close-like-really-close" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep Your Camera Close (like, really close)"></a>1. Keep Your Camera Close (like, really close)</h2><p>The biggest problem with the mic built into any camera or phone is just that, since it’s with the camera, it’s usually too far away from you. Built-in mics can record decent audio up close, but usually, your camera will be set up farther away from you than an external mic would be.</p><p>For example, your camera’s mic might be just as good as a clip-on LAV, but that LAV is right by your mouth and the camera is a couple of big steps away.</p><p>Moving your camera&#x2F;smartphone physically closer to you will make it hard to include anything besides your head and shoulders in your shot, but it will get you significantly better audio.</p><h2 id="2-Shoot-Somewhere-Quiet"><a href="#2-Shoot-Somewhere-Quiet" class="headerlink" title="2.Shoot Somewhere Quiet"></a>2.Shoot Somewhere Quiet</h2><p>The best way to limit the amount of background noise you pick up in your sound recording is to shoot somewhere where there’s no background noise. That probably seems really basic, but it’s something a lot of people just don’t do. It’s easy to default to recording in your home office, even though it’s right next to the kitchen where your family is bustling around, or in your bedroom even though there’s a busy street right outside your window.</p><p>Sometimes the best thing you can do for your audio is simply to scout out a quiet room in your house where the sound recording conditions are better. Speaking of recording conditions…</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fm0XhU5H8R4?si=cFPk6XK3X3CQSI7Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Pick-a-Good-Room"><a href="#3-Pick-a-Good-Room" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick a Good Room"></a>3. Pick a Good Room</h2><p>There’s more that goes into picking a good room than how quiet it is. If you try to record in a room that’s too big your voice might sound to distant, and if you try to record in a room that’s too small your audio will be too echo-y. You need a room that’s just right.</p><p>You should also pay attention to what’s in the room you’re recording in. Avoid hard, reflective, surfaces like appliances and mirrors which your voice will bounce off of. The same conditions that make you sound great when you sing in the shower will – like recording in a small space -make your voiceover unpleasantly echo-y.</p><p>Look for a room that has a lot of soft things in it, like beds and sofas.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GU08CQVsZz0?si=V-SvPfzRsQysMS0e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Protect-your-Built-In-Mic-from-Wind"><a href="#4-Protect-your-Built-In-Mic-from-Wind" class="headerlink" title="4. Protect your Built-In Mic from Wind"></a>4. Protect your Built-In Mic from Wind</h2><p>If you shoot outside, then the wind passing over your built-in mic will do terrible things to your audio. You can do a lot to counter-act this problem by physically blocking the wind.</p><p>There are a few ways to do this. If you’re doing hand-held shots you can partially cover your camera or phone’s mic with your finger. You don’t want to completely cover it&#x2F;press down or your audio will be muffled. What you’re trying to do is create a barrier blocking out the wind.</p><p>On movie sets, they block out wind by covering the microphones with big fuzzy things called ‘dead cats’. You can also block out wind noise by attaching something fuzzy to your microphone. If your camera’s built-in mic is on front of it then you just need something big and fluffy you can loop around the lens. You can use a piece of a boa, a fuzzy novelty scrunchie – you can even murder a fuzzy stuffed animal! Do you have an old coat with a fuzz around the hood? That fuzz would do nicely.</p><p><em>The pompom used in this video cost $2, but you might already have something that would work!</em></p><p>If your built-in mic is on top of your camera you can get something called a ‘micromuff’. A micromuff is essentially a circular or rectangular piece of velcro with long strands of fluff on top. It’s open in the middle so it doesn’t actually cover your mic, but the surrounding fuzz blocks out the wind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-better-audio-from-wind.jpg"                      alt="Record better audio from wind with micromuff"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dn-24B6AURY?si=ErES2KWVnintY6h9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>You use the adhesive backing to attach the base velcro to your camera. The other side of the velcro has your fluff attached to the back.</em></p><p>The only thing about a micromuff is that it costs about $30, and if you’re going to spend $30 on audio equipment then you could just buy yourself an inexpensive LAV mic. I only bring up the micromuff because it’s a very simple design you can probably DIY – you just need velcro with adhesive backing and any of the fluff-sources we just discussed.</p><h2 id="5-Use-a-Free-Audio-App"><a href="#5-Use-a-Free-Audio-App" class="headerlink" title="5. Use a Free Audio App"></a>5. Use a Free Audio App</h2><p>If you’re recording on a smartphone, you can download a free app that will let you make adjustments to your audio as you record it. With the right app, you can adjust your gain (volume is how you control ‘output’ audio, and gain is for ‘input’ audio. By turning up your gain, you can make your mic more sensitive), tempo, and more. A lot of the time, your audio recording app will also let you edit your audio afterward.</p><p>Even if you’re not recording video from your smartphone, it might be a good idea to use your phone as your mic and record a separate audio file. You’ll be able to use an app to fine-tune your recording, and you can set your phone up closer to you the way you would an external mic while keeping your camera back a bit farther.</p><p>Free audio apps: Hi-Q MP3 Voice Recorder (Android), RecForge II (Android), Smart Voice Recorder (Android), Audio Memos (iOS), and Recorder Plus (iOS).</p><h2 id="6-Do-a-Sound-Check"><a href="#6-Do-a-Sound-Check" class="headerlink" title="6. Do a Sound Check"></a>6. Do a Sound Check</h2><p>Once you think you’ve got good audio set up – test it! You don’t want to do a whole video and find out when you play it back that your audio doesn’t sound good.</p><p>Do you have any of your own audio tips to pass on?

Reading makes it easier for them to understand.</li><li>This also helps people with hearing impairments. People with troubled ears can still watch and understand your content.</li><li>It’s a great aid to such videos which have been recorded in other foreign languages that you don’t understand. Hence it will increase the number of viewers all around the world.</li><li>They both are generally added for easy accessibility to the viewers who wish to watch in sound sensitive environments.</li></ul><p> So, here we are going to show you two ways to add subtittles to video: directly or uploading caption or transcript files</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKjioJQaUh8?si=Ls_AeuvGsSyL5ny2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Adding-subtitles-and-closed-captions-manually"><a href="#Adding-subtitles-and-closed-captions-manually" class="headerlink" title="Adding subtitles and closed captions manually"></a>Adding subtitles and closed captions manually</h2><p> To add subtitles and closed captions to your YouTube video, fisrt, you should sign in to your YouTube account.

Their goal is to create YouTube as a global platform for sharing videos. A huge $1.65 billion was paid by Google for buying YouTube. YouTube then became a more popular website with over two billion users every month.</p><p>Lots of creators, like makeup artists and gamers, make money on YouTube. With the platform, you can livestream, make money from your videos, and watch tons of user-made videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube: what is it"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c17xsnbinCQ?si=xHKslFgC3QbxY4qW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Dailymotion-What-is-it"><a href="#Dailymotion-What-is-it" class="headerlink" title="Dailymotion: What is it?"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.dailymotion.com/" >Dailymotion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>: What is it?</h3><p>A French entrepreneur and an English entrepreneur founded Dailymotion in 2005. Dailymotion became one of the most popular video platforms in France and then Europe in just 1 year. You can upload and share videos on Dailymotion like on YouTube. There is a slight difference in their focus. Dailymotion’s content tends to be professional, while YouTube’s is user-made.</p><p>Dailymotion has over 300 million users every month. It’s accessible in 35 different languages. Also, for pro content, it offers features like “Motionmaker” to users and live streaming to creators.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-3.jpg"                      alt="dailymotion: what is it"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZma8PBO0D8?si=9-qQgGVTuChYd27a" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-popularity-and-user-base-of-YouTube-and-Dailymotion"><a href="#The-popularity-and-user-base-of-YouTube-and-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="The popularity and user base of YouTube and Dailymotion"></a>The popularity and user base of YouTube and Dailymotion</h3><p>YouTube’s user interface is very easy and simple to use.

It allows you to upload videos, customize your banner, and create a community.</p><p>It is easy to stream videos or share them with friends by creating playlists. YouTube and Dailymotion both have easy-to-use interfaces. You can customize your own channel, and it has categories and channels.

It even offers live streaming concerts and mind-blowing documentaries. Gamer, beauty, sports, and learning enthusiasts will enjoy this channel.</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload 12-hour-long videos to increase your watch time. You can also share all types of experiences in the long video. Every day, 2.51 billion active users watch over one billion hours of content. Creators can showcase their work in high definition, up to 8K, on the platform, which is a major advantage. Mobile devices and smartphones also allow offline viewing of videos.</p><h4 id="Dailymotion-Content-and-Audience"><a href="#Dailymotion-Content-and-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Dailymotion Content and Audience"></a>Dailymotion Content and Audience</h4><p>There’s something special about Dailymotion.

Let’s have a look at the monetization options available on YouTube and Dailymotion. It is possible to earn money from your content on both Dailymotion and YouTube.

Unlike YouTube, Dailymotion allows creators to earn money through ads.</p><p>The Dailymotion Partner Program has made several French video creators extremely wealthy. The CPM is always low for video creators around the world, for whatever reason. Dailymotion Partners from France earn 3000 - 4000 euros per month. Global Partners withdraw the monthly least of $100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-4.jpg"                      alt="programs and options for dailymotion monetization"                ></p><h3 id="Monetization-Requirements-and-Earning-Potential"><a href="#Monetization-Requirements-and-Earning-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential"></a>Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential</h3><p>YouTube’s YPP monetizes accounts with 1,000 subscribers and earns revenue through advertising. You’ll get 55% of the revenue generated by the ads shown during, before, and after your videos. It is also possible to charge channel memberships. For every 1,000 views, the average YouTuber makes about $18.</p><p>The Dailymotion Partner Program monetizes your videos.

It’s important to think about who your audience is.</li><li>Are Your Videos Targeted? Do your videos match specific search queries?</li><li>Video Length and Size: How long and big are your videos?</li><li>Monetization: Want to make money?

YouTube then became a more popular website with over two billion users every month.</p><p>Lots of creators, like makeup artists and gamers, make money on YouTube.

Dailymotion became one of the most popular video platforms in France and then Europe in just 1 year. You can upload and share videos on Dailymotion like on YouTube. There is a slight difference in their focus. Dailymotion’s content tends to be professional, while YouTube’s is user-made.</p><p>Dailymotion has over 300 million users every month. It’s accessible in 35 different languages. Also, for pro content, it offers features like “Motionmaker” to users and live streaming to creators.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-3.jpg"                      alt="dailymotion: what is it"                ></p><h3 id="The-popularity-and-user-base-of-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-1"><a href="#The-popularity-and-user-base-of-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-1" class="headerlink" title="The popularity and user base of YouTube and Dailymotion"></a>The popularity and user base of YouTube and Dailymotion</h3><p>YouTube’s user interface is very easy and simple to use.

You can watch YouTube without ads and gain access to YouTube analytics.</p><p>It’s cool to create your own channel on YouTube. It allows you to upload videos, customize your banner, and create a community.</p><p>It is easy to stream videos or share them with friends by creating playlists. YouTube and Dailymotion both have easy-to-use interfaces. You can customize your own channel, and it has categories and channels.

However, the <strong>YouTube view monetization programs are</strong> not that clear. Most people don’t even know how YouTube monetization views work. How many views on YouTube do you need to start making money from your content on the platform? Some people have even been made to believe the common misconception that views alone determine the amount of money a YouTuber earns. Let’s have a look at what entails views for YouTube monetization and the factors that affect your earnings on the platform.</p><p><strong>YouTube Channel Grower</strong> A cross-platform for enhancing and editing YouTube videos for more engagement!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3koT_-kvbks?si=sQV7FzPiz6GYITrE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money"></a><strong>Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money</strong></h2><p>Despite a lot of people seeking a successful career on YouTube, only a handful make it big on the platform. Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views. Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YCkNXJjC3c?si=9Tn8KiqKGTZi1o7E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/poI1NQxHfjc?si=ZLG0wziYcTKIKwL5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View"></a><strong>Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels. The actual revenue will depend on several factors.</p><ul><li><a href="#factor1">Factors Affecting Earnings per View</a></li><li><a href="#factor2">YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</a></li><li><a href="#factor3">Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</a></li><li><a href="#factor4">Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</a></li></ul><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting Earnings per View"></a><strong>Factors Affecting Earnings per View</strong></h3><p>The amount of money YouTubers make per view is affected by various factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ad Revenue Rates</strong>: The rates vary depending on the country where viewers are located, the time of the year, and the ad your YouTube channel is running.</li><li><strong>Audience Demographics</strong>: Advertisers usually pay more to show their ads to viewers in some demographics, especially those who are interested in specific products or have a high income.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: Videos with high CTR and AVD earn more income from ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time</strong>: YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time earn more money.</li></ul><h3 id="YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model"><a href="#YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model"></a><strong>YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</strong></h3><p>The YouTibe’s revenue-sharing model determines how much creators are paid. The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4lRBnNnd9k?si=5e0MbdOz-fF6Ry_k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers.

It is to see from these statistics why every video aspiring YouTubers post on their channels has to be perfect in every way in order to reach a wide audience. Fortunately, trimming a video even after you’ve uploaded it to YouTube is a quick and easy process, and in this article, we are going to show you a few different methods you can use to trim the videos you upload to YouTube. So, let’s get started.</p><hr><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Trimming a Video Before Posting On YouTube with Filmora Video Editor [4 Ways] </a></li><li><a href="#part3">Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="How-to-Trim-a-Video-After-You-Upload-it-to-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#How-to-Trim-a-Video-After-You-Upload-it-to-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?"></a>How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?</h2><p>The <strong>YouTube Studio</strong> is no longer in beta phase, which means that the feature is here to stay. This is good news for all video creators who frequently update their YouTube videos after they upload them, as they no longer have to go through the endless uploads just because they wanted to trim a video.</p><p>Make sure that you’re signed into your YouTube channel, then click on your <strong>profile picture</strong> and select the <strong>YouTube Studio (Beta)</strong> option. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like <strong>Analytics, Dashboard or Videos</strong>, so just click on the <strong>Videos</strong> option and proceed to select a video you’d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Editor</strong> option and the video you selected will open in the YouTube’s video editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-editor-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube videos after uploading "                ></p><p>Click on the <strong>Trim button</strong> to start trimming the video and drag the <strong>blue bars</strong> located at the start and the end of the file to designate the portion of the video you’d like to remove. Preview the changes and confirm what you’ve made by clicking on the <strong>Save</strong> button located in the upper right corner of the screen and the new shortened version of the video will become available within a couple of hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-save-video-trimming-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio - Trim YouTube videos after uploading "                ></p><p>In this way, you don’t need to take down the original video, edit it and re-upload.

Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> drop-down menu and select the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the <strong>Media tab</strong>, and you can just <strong>drag and drop</strong> it to a video track on the timeline.</p><p>All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag <strong>one of its ends to the left or to the right</strong>. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display <strong>the remaining footage</strong> while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to <strong>extend the file by dragging it</strong> until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool"></a>Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool</h4><p>Filmora’s <strong>Split tool</strong> can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply <strong>place the playhead</strong> at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make <strong>a cut</strong>, and click on the <strong>Split icon</strong> that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the <strong>Delete</strong> button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Scene Detection"></a>Method 3: Using Scene Detection</h4><p>Wondershare’s video editor also offers an <strong>automatic way to split a video</strong> clip into a number of separate scenes. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the <strong>Scene Detection</strong> option from the menu and proceed to click on the <strong>Detect button</strong>, after the <strong>Scene Detection window</strong> pops up on the screen. The software will then <strong>automatically analyze the footage</strong> and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the <strong>Add to Timeline button</strong> once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection-interface.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Scene Detection Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool"></a>Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool</h4><p>The <strong>Instant Cutter Tool</strong> enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora. Select the <strong>Import with Instant Cutter Tool option</strong> from the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and wait for the <strong>Filmora Instant Cutter</strong> window to appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see <strong>Trim and Merge tabs</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>Trim tab</strong> is selected and then click on the <strong>Open File button</strong> to import a video clip you’d like to trim. You can then use <strong>the trimming sliders</strong> to designate the parts of the video you’d like to remove or the set the <strong>In and Out points</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Set In Point or Set Out Point icons</strong>. Click on the <strong>Export button</strong> to save the new version of the video clip and <strong>click OK</strong> to complete the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instant-cutter-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Instant Cutter Tool"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCqHbpxQGP4?si=XGkajFHdqyoKNAFM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwOwUI47FuU?si=NK7IEELjx7_SJSl2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos"></a>Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos</h2><p>In case you’re looking for a tool that lets you save extracts of scenes from YouTube to your computer free of charge <a class="link"   href="https://ytcutter.com/" >YT Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may be one of your best options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yt-cutter-youtube-trimmer.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos online "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vca--yEhtdo?si=7ijqjyP-oi3LYze1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This online video editing platform is remarkably easy to use since you just have to <strong>copy</strong> <strong>the link to the YouTube video</strong> you’d like to trim into <strong>YT Cutter’s URL box</strong> and then select how long the new video should be.

There are tons of free stock photo websites out there to help you find a high-quality picture that’s perfect for your channel.</p><h4 id="DON’T-Use-Chaotic-Patterns"><a href="#DON’T-Use-Chaotic-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="DON’T: Use Chaotic Patterns"></a><em>DON’T: Use Chaotic Patterns</em></h4><p>Using patterns for the background of your channel banner can help your channel look super creative and stand out from others. However, if you use a pattern that is chaotic and hard on the eyes, you may not attract many subscribers. When using patterns, choose patterns that are not heavy in color and have too many lines or shapes. There should be an evenness to the shapes and negative space within the pattern itself. Try to stay away from patterns that are 3D which can conflict with the viewer’s eyesight and make them dizzy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-banner-background.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Channel Banner Background"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XS1nQCe95LU?si=A2dhdFkSAI61_nKA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Should-I-Use-My-Face"><a href="#Part-2-Should-I-Use-My-Face" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Should I Use My Face?"></a>Part 2: Should I Use My Face?</h2><p>Whether you should use your face on your channel banner depends on what your channel is about. If you have a channel focused on beauty, fashion, fitness, or family vlogs then it’s a good idea to include your face. It comes off personable and helps viewers relate to you. If you have a channel that is about something like gaming, tech reviews, or book reviews then it isn’t necessary to include your face because the focus of your content isn’t you as a personality.</p><p>If you do include pictures, here are some tips:</p><h4 id="Don’t-Use-Blurry-Photos"><a href="#Don’t-Use-Blurry-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Don’t: Use Blurry Photos"></a><em>Don’t: Use Blurry Photos</em></h4><p>If your photos are blurry, pixilated, or poor quality then don’t use them. Using blurry pictures comes off as unprofessional.</p><p>That doesn’t mean you have to hire a photographer to take pictures for your channel. The average smartphone takes really great pictures, so long as you have enough light. If you need a great picture, use a high-quality selfie or ask a friend to take a nice picture of you.</p><h4 id="Don’t-Use-Outdated-Pictures"><a href="#Don’t-Use-Outdated-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="Don’t: Use Outdated Pictures"></a><em>Don’t: Use Outdated Pictures</em></h4><p>It is always best to use a current photo of yourself. Many times viewers will go and follow you on social media as well. If they see that you have current photos on your social media but not on your channel, they are become confused and perhaps lose interest.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOyLy8DeizY?si=GkAmK0hChZw6_2tW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What-Should-I-Write-on-My-Banner"><a href="#Part-3-What-Should-I-Write-on-My-Banner" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Should I Write on My Banner?"></a>Part 3: What Should I Write on My Banner?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-banner-write.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Channel Banner writing"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xg3PHS_Ee80?si=fE_iGIqHjKvWFIN3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Do-Include-Your-Channel-Name"><a href="#Do-Include-Your-Channel-Name" class="headerlink" title="Do: Include Your Channel Name"></a><em>Do: Include Your Channel Name</em></h4><p>While including your channel name in your banner seems like a no brainer, it is often left out by aspiring YouTubers. Displaying your channel name in a large font allows it to be more visible for viewers - your channel name is already on the page, but it is underneath your channel art and doesn’t stand out.</p><p>Seeing your channel name included in your banner also helps viewers to know they are on the right page, if there are YouTubers out there with similar names to yours.</p><h4 id="Do-Include-Upload-Days"><a href="#Do-Include-Upload-Days" class="headerlink" title="Do: Include Upload Days"></a><em>Do: Include Upload Days</em></h4><p>Consistent upload days are highly important for gaining more views and subscribers. Including your exact upload days helps viewers know when they should expect new videos from you. I made the mistake of not including upload days when I first started my channel 3 years ago. I had drops in views because my subscribers didn’t know when I would upload videos.</p><p>If you find that you cannot stick to a certain upload day, try to include how often you will post instead. For example, you can say, “New Videos Posted Weekly.” Viewers will respect you more and even be more likely to subscribe when you tell them your upload days. They want a guarantee that you’re going to post again in the near future.</p><h4 id="Do-Include-Social-Media"><a href="#Do-Include-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="Do: Include Social Media"></a><em>Do: Include Social Media</em></h4><p>Social media accounts are important to include in your channel art because we live in a social media generation. People are on social media every second of the day. If you are looking to take your YouTube channel seriously, it is good practice to ask viewers to follow you on your social media.</p><p>Including social media icons in your channel art lets people know where they can find you. Another good reason to include your current social media in your banner is that sometimes you might join a new platform or quit an old one. You may be using Twitter for months and then decide that you like Facebook better. Your current social media handles keep subscribers from having to guess which one to follow you on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-banner-safe-area.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Channel Banner Safe Area"                ></p><p><em>Make sure everything important fits in the safe area!</em></p><h4 id="Do-Include-Brief-Channel-Description-or-Tag-Line"><a href="#Do-Include-Brief-Channel-Description-or-Tag-Line" class="headerlink" title="Do: Include Brief Channel Description or Tag Line"></a><em>Do: Include Brief Channel Description or Tag Line</em></h4><p>Aside from your channel name, you should also include a brief channel description or tag line to tell your viewers what your channel is all about. If you’re an aspiring beauty guru, you may include something like Makeup Tutorials, Product Reviews, or Mommy Makeovers. Or, you may include a cool tag line that describes the goal of your channel, like “Empowering Mother’s Through Makeup.”</p><p>I’ve noticed that YouTubers that use 2-3 descriptive words in their channel art make many different types of videos on their channel but they all full under those categories.</p><p>YouTubers that use tag lines are using their channel as a platform to carry out a specific mission on giving help or educating others.</p><p>Whether you decide to use descriptive words or a tag line, they will help your channel tremendously by setting expectations for your viewers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_69vX9wnRE?si=FtLxkpRhPORqcMeE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-Can-I-Make-My-Channel-Art-Look-Good"><a href="#Part-4-How-Can-I-Make-My-Channel-Art-Look-Good" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How Can I Make My Channel Art Look Good?"></a>Part 4: How Can I Make My Channel Art Look Good?</h2><h4 id="Do-Create-Consistent-Branding"><a href="#Do-Create-Consistent-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Do: Create Consistent Branding"></a><em>Do: Create Consistent Branding</em></h4><p>Since becoming a YouTuber myself, I’ve come to learn that paying attention to your branding is very important. Focus attention to what colors and fonts you use. The colors you use for your channel can influence your audience to feel a certain way. For example, using yellow can show that you’re happy and upbeat while using blue can show you’re more calm and relaxed. Whatever color you choose, make sure it’s a true representation of who you are.</p><p>Using the right font can also be important to your channel. There are many different fonts available now. When choosing a font, choose one that goes with your channel that is easy to read. You might choose a very pretty cursive font, but if your viewers can’t read it, it can be useless.</p><h4 id="Don’t-Include-Images-That-Have-Nothing-to-Do-with-Your-Channel"><a href="#Don’t-Include-Images-That-Have-Nothing-to-Do-with-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Don’t: Include Images That Have Nothing to Do with Your Channel"></a><em>Don’t: Include Images That Have Nothing to Do with Your Channel</em></h4><p>This simple mistake can cost you many subscribers. For example, if your channel is about Beauty videos, then your channel art shouldn’t include pictures of food or you eating a burger. Your channel art is the first thing that viewers see when clicking on your page. You want them to instantly know what your channel is all about without having to find it in the description box. If your channel is about a few different things, then include all of those images in the channel art so they still know what your channel about. Just don’t confuse your viewers as to what your channel is really about.</p><h4 id="Don’t-Have-Images-and-Text-That-Cut-Off"><a href="#Don’t-Have-Images-and-Text-That-Cut-Off" class="headerlink" title="Don’t: Have Images and Text That Cut Off"></a><em>Don’t: Have Images and Text That Cut Off</em></h4><p>YouTube helps YouTubers by giving them a free channel art template to use as a guide when creating channel art. The template includes 3 different perspectives on how your channel art will be viewed by people looking at mobile devices, computer screens, and TVs. Many people make the mistake of creating art on the TV perspective which then cuts off images and text for the mobile and computer views. To save you the trouble of having images that cut off, it’s best to create your channel in the mobile dimensions that way it will be seen in the computer and TV dimensions with no problem.</p><p><em>Joshelle is a YouTuber from Atlanta, GA.

Camera shake is a huge distraction and, if it is a persistent problem in your YouTube videos, it will be hard to get subscribers. Shakiness is an easy problem to correct. With a bit of equipment, or a bit of creativity, it is easy to make sure your YouTube videos are nice and smooth.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5aJC8okA8s?si=L2rnYAp-gmGlLQSf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Camera-Stabilizers-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Best-Camera-Stabilizers-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube"></a>Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube</h2><p> This article will talk about different types of equipment you can use to stabilize your camera. For vloggers on a budget, there is even one tip on stabilizing your camera without camera equipment. Here are some of the best stabilizers for YouTube videos:</p><h4 id="Part-1-Tripod"><a href="#Part-1-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Tripod"></a>Part 1. Tripod</h4><p> A tripod is a three-legged stand you can mount your camera to. The height of a tripod can be adjusted so you can set your camera up at the level that works best for you. Because tripods can stand alone you can set your camera up to record yourself without needing a helper.</p><p> Tripods are the best choice for vlogs that revolve around you standing (or sitting) and delivering information, like opinion or beauty vlogs.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Monopod"><a href="#Part-2-Monopod" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Monopod"></a>Part 2. Monopod</h4><p> A monopod is like a tripod in the sense that you can adjust its height, but unlike a tripod a monopod has only one leg and cannot stand by itself. You will need a helper to stay with your camera if you plan to film yourself using a monopod. A monopod is more portable than a tripod, though, and can be used in a wider variety of places. You can even use a monopod to record aerial shots just by picking it up.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Pistol-Grip"><a href="#Part-3-Pistol-Grip" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Pistol Grip"></a>Part 3. Pistol Grip</h4><p> A pistol grip is a handle you mount your camera to the top of. You can carry your camera around on top of the pistol grip, or you can mount the grip itself to your tripod or monopod. Once the grip is mounted you can use it to more easily control your camera movements. This is a great way to get even, steady, camera pans.</p><h4 id="Part-4-Selfie-Stick"><a href="#Part-4-Selfie-Stick" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Selfie Stick"></a>Part 4. Selfie Stick</h4><p> A selfie stick is a long pole you mount your smartphone to one end of in order to take selfies from farther away. Selfie sticks also make great stabilizers if you are shooting video on your smartphone. To stabilize your smartphone place the handle of your selfie stick on the ground as if it were a monopod. When you are shooting using a selfie stick you can also hold it up in the air to get interesting high angle shots.</p><p> Some YouTubers even like to shoot selfie-style vlogs where the hold the selfie stick just like they are taking a photo of themselves.</p><h4 id="Part-5-OIS-–-Optical-Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Part-5-OIS-–-Optical-Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization"></a>Part 5. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization</h4><p> ‘Optical Image Stabilization’ is fairly new hardware which is built in to a lot of new smartphones, like the iPhone 6S Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. OIS reduces camera shake by a lot, although it is still a good idea to stabilize your smartphone while you record. OIS will also help you take sharper still photos without using any software.</p><h4 id="Part-6-Tables-Desks-Trees-ect"><a href="#Part-6-Tables-Desks-Trees-ect" class="headerlink" title="Part 6. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect"></a>Part 6. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect</h4><p> If you do not have equipment, or cannot bring it where you want to shoot, then you can still record steady footage. You just have to get creative with where you put your camera. Any stable surface will do. You can set your camera down on a shelf in your house, a picnic bench, or up in a tree.</p><p> If you are able to lean your elbows onto a desk or table while you hold your camera then that will also significantly cut down on camera shake.

He started his channel on December 9, 2006. Jesse never guessed that he would make enough money to live off of the videos he was creating. Here are some of the ways that he monetized his channel:</p><h4 id="AdSense"><a href="#AdSense" class="headerlink" title="AdSense"></a>AdSense</h4><p>Monetization of videos through AdSense is one of the easiest ways that you can start to profit off your videos. Registering for a <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#?modal%5Factive=none" >Google AdSense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can earn you between $0.30 and $2.00 per thousand ad impressions (an impression is a click, not a view). How much you make per ad impression depends on a lot of things, including the time of year. There are good months for advertising revenue and bad months. December is usually the hottest month for making money through AdSense because of the holiday shopping season. Some of the other months where you can see huge profits include September for back-to-school, June, and March.</p><p>More popular channels get higher paying ads, and it is harder to earn ad revenue in popular vlogging genres (i.e. gaming) than in more obscure niches.</p><h4 id="Target-the-Right-Demographic"><a href="#Target-the-Right-Demographic" class="headerlink" title="Target the Right Demographic"></a>Target the Right Demographic</h4><p>Some of the largest YouTuber success stories are creators who primarily target younger audiences. Others target men or women specifically. Think about who you want your audience to be and make videos that will appeal to them.</p><h4 id="Multichannel-Networks"><a href="#Multichannel-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Multichannel Networks"></a>Multichannel Networks</h4><p>Once you hit a certain level of subscribership and views you will start getting invited to MCMs. In some cases, multichannel network promotions could entitle you to discounts on merchandise and products. Be careful: a multichannel network will always want you to sign a contract, and they will take over your AdSense account.</p><h4 id="Social-Blade"><a href="#Social-Blade" class="headerlink" title="Social Blade"></a>Social Blade</h4><p>This site will provide details about your subscription count, which of your videos has the best watch time, and more. It will give you a good impression of what you should be including in your videos and how you can make more money from your channel.</p><h4 id="Uploading-Your-Videos-at-the-Right-Time"><a href="#Uploading-Your-Videos-at-the-Right-Time" class="headerlink" title="Uploading Your Videos at the Right Time"></a>Uploading Your Videos at the Right Time</h4><p>Uploading videos at the right time will make sure that you are on the front page of recently uploaded videos when people are let out of school or taking a break from work. This will earn you lots of views. Set an upload time for all of your videos each day and stick to that schedule.</p><h4 id="Check-out-Webinars"><a href="#Check-out-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Check out Webinars"></a>Check out Webinars</h4><p>Looking into webinars and videos of what other popular YouTube experts have done will help you model their success.</p><h4 id="Collaborate-with-Other-YouTubers"><a href="#Collaborate-with-Other-YouTubers" class="headerlink" title="Collaborate with Other YouTubers"></a>Collaborate with Other YouTubers</h4><p>When you create a collab video you and your partner are each introduced to each other’s subscribers.</p><h4 id="Keep-Quality-Up"><a href="#Keep-Quality-Up" class="headerlink" title="Keep Quality Up"></a>Keep Quality Up</h4><p>Putting time and effort into every upload will ensure that you won’t lose subscribers or viewers because you got a bit lazy.</p><h4 id="Do-Follow-Up-Videos"><a href="#Do-Follow-Up-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Do Follow-Up Videos"></a>Do Follow-Up Videos</h4><p>If you have a particular video that has a lot of views, you may want to consider creating follow-up videos. This can be a great way to generate lots of views.</p><h4 id="Complete-Regular-Research"><a href="#Complete-Regular-Research" class="headerlink" title="Complete Regular Research"></a>Complete Regular Research</h4><p>Regular research into your target market will help you to create the trendiest new content.</p><h4 id="Don’t-Get-Discouraged"><a href="#Don’t-Get-Discouraged" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Get Discouraged"></a>Don’t Get Discouraged</h4><p>Timing and luck are definitely two of the biggest factors in becoming a success on YouTube. If you are willing to keep working and don’t get discouraged you will eventually earn profits.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O7ChChlyX2o?si=7pMKdN1NZig1kYek" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;

This is because the platform allows content creators to categorize their videos into public, private, or unlisted based on their preferences.</p><p>To help you uncover the content that you otherwise wouldn’t have access to, we’ve compiled a detailed guide to show you how to find YouTube hidden videos. We’ve also explained why so many unlisted videos are now labeled as private.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="4-Types-of-Videos-on-YouTube"><a href="#4-Types-of-Videos-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="4 Types of Videos on YouTube"></a>4 Types of Videos on YouTube</h2><p>Firstly, let’s learn about the background of the types of YouTube videos. YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:</p><p><strong>Public Videos:</strong> YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.</p><p>So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: “<strong>Public</strong> <strong>Videos</strong>.” It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.</p><p><strong>Private Videos</strong>: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video’s shareable link can watch it.</p><p>Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube. Hence, it is a great way to share sensitive or personal information with a select group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-on-youtube.png"                      alt="private video on youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Unlisted Video</strong> Unlisted videos on YouTube are not publicly visible on the site. They can only be seen by people who have the URL. This category works as a bridge between private and public videos. It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.</p><p>You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family.
