You can do this by clicking on the file, import, and import media.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now drag the music video from the Library and drop it into the Filmora timeline.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now drag your reaction video and drop it above the original music video in the track.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Decrease the size of your reaction video by using the canvas controls in the preview window and adjusting it to any side of the window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/youtube-music-reaction-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="how to make reaction video with Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> If you want to keep your reaction video in a big frame and your music video in a small one, you can do the opposite.</p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> If you want to add any effects or call-outs to your video, you can use the rich elements library of Filmora, where you can find hundreds of interactive elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/youtube-music-reaction-videos-2.jpg"                      alt="how to make reaction video with Filmora - add effects"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Once you have finalized the video, click on the import button and save the video to your computer in your desired format.

There are lots of places to get them.</p><p>We’ve made a list of 6 sites where you can download icons and logos for free for YouTub videos, and explained how they work.</p><blockquote><ul><li><a href="#flaticon">Flaticon.com</a></li><li><a href="#freepik">Freepik.com</a></li><li><a href="#seeklogo">Seeklogo.net</a></li><li><a href="#iconarchive">IconArchive.com</a></li><li><a href="#logaster">Logaster.com</a></li><li><a href="#icons8">Icons8.com</a></li></ul></blockquote><p>You might also want to check out these YouTube channels offering free <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html" >profile picture templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMEJvwMM0vk?si=EQF_jo_4u9v5iJ_C" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Flaticon-com"><a href="#1-Flaticon-com" class="headerlink" title="1. Flaticon.com"></a>1. Flaticon.com</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>Great selection of icons&#x2F;logos</em></li><li><em>It’s easy to change the colors before you download</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>I’m putting Flaticon.com right at the top of this list because it has something that really sets it apart from the other sites on this list – it lets you edit pre-made icons before you download them.</p><p>You start out on Flaticon by searching for a theme like beauty, gaming, flowers, or emojis. I searched for ‘birds’ and found these cuties.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon Download Site Flaticon"                ></p><p><em>These aren’t all the birds on Flaticon, just a few.</em> <em>They had a huge selection in all the different searches I tried.</em></p><p>I clicked on the brown bird to open up the download screen, and then clicked into ‘Edit icon’. There may be a pop up that tells you editing tools are only available to registered users, but it’s wrong. Just close it and keep going, unless you want to register.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-flaticon-example-1.jpg"                      alt="Logo Icon on Flaticon"                ></p><p>You can edit the colors in your icon just by clicking on the color you want to replace, and then clicking on the color in the color selector you want to replace it with. I made my birdie FLY.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg"                      alt="Edit Logo Icon on Flaticon"                ></p><p><em>I never apologize for puns.</em></p><p>Once you like the look of your icon, just click Download. You will be prompted to choose a format. PNG is the most popular because it is supported the most places (including on YouTube), and because it allows for a transparent background.</p><p>After clicking on a format you will also be prompted to choose a size for your image. It’s always best to go with the largest image you can – its way easier to shrink things and keep them looking good than it is to have to enlarge them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg"                      alt="download Logo Icon on Flaticon"                ></p><p>Flaticon has a great selection, it’s free, and they make it really easy to edit your creations. I would strongly recommend this site to anyone in the market for an icon or logo.</p><p>Flaticon asks that you include an “Icon made by [author link] from &lt;<a href="http://www.flaticon.com>">www.flaticon.com&gt;</a> ” somewhere (i.e. video description, channel ‘about’ section) when you use their icons for free.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIP8ktrmOdg?si=zRnjbGzM6PDx2jCq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Freepik-com"><a href="#2-Freepik-com" class="headerlink" title="2. Freepik.com"></a>2. Freepik.com</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>Good selection of icons.</em></li><li><em>No way to customise them on the site.</em></li><li><em>Attribution requried.</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>On freepik, you start off by searching for a theme (like the genre of your YouTube title or the topic of a video, i.e. ‘makeup’ or ‘music’). I searched for ‘cat’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-freepik.jpg"                      alt="download Logo Icon on Freepik"                ></p><p><em>A few of the sets available on freepik. The crown icon means you need to be a paying Premium member, but most things are free.</em></p><p>You can’t edit on freepik, and in order to download for free you need to include an attribution&#x2F;credit to freepik where you use the images.</p><p>You do not choose what format to download your images in on freepik. When you hit ‘Free Download’ it will automatically download a zip file which will contain both a .jpg and a .eps. The EPS is editable in any ‘vector graphics editor’, like Adobe Illustrator, and YouTube supports .jpg files.</p><h2 id="3-Seeklogo-net"><a href="#3-Seeklogo-net" class="headerlink" title="3. Seeklogo.net"></a>3. Seeklogo.net</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>Logos from major brands</em></li><li><em>Great for channels that do product reviews</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>Seeklogo.net has a slightly more corporate slant than some of the other sites on this list. It has logos for a lot of major companies and brands available for download.</p><p>In the ‘search’ on Seeklogo.net, you can type in the name of a brand or industry and see if the well-known logo you’re looking for is available. This may be especially useful for people with sports related channels since they have a lot of logos for major teams.</p><p>I searched for YouTube – you never know when you might need the YouTube logo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-icons-logos-on-seeklogo.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon on Seeklogo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaWcXdTn5SE?si=QbxEkX-4a17J5RVs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Although the site does not advertise PNG in the list of formats on their front page, downloads do include PNG versions (which is useful if you need transparency and don’t have a program which can edit vector files, like .eps).</p><h2 id="4-IconArchive-com"><a href="#4-IconArchive-com" class="headerlink" title="4. IconArchive.com"></a>4. IconArchive.com</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>Site has an office&#x2F;business slant.</em></li><li><em>Detailed search tool lets you sort by color, theme, etc.</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>IconArchive has a huge selection of icons with somewhat of an office&#x2F;business slant. I searched for ‘flower’ and half the results were of file-folders with flowers on them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-iconarchive.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon on IconArchive"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Jfq2Wx1Bcs?si=YQrYpTy0g4aV5QaO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Could be cool for a lifestyle video about school or work?</em></p><p>My favorite thing about IconArchive is its search features. It allows you to filter results by color, size (down to the specific resolution), category, background color, style, and a lot more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-icons-logos-on-iconarchive.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon on IconArchive Editing"                ></p><p>Color is under ‘Display’, meaning that it won’t filter out results that have different colors it’ll just list the color you select first.</p><p>The ‘Category’ filter is useful because there are some genres you probably recognize there, like ‘Lifestyle’. However, you should be careful not to over-filter. This site is pretty literal in how it categorizes. For example – there are no ‘flower’ images under ‘Lifestyle’.</p><p>Downloads are available in different sizes and formats including PNG. PNG is always a good option because it is supported by YouTube and includes transparent backgrounds.</p><p>Note that all of your different download buttons will be located underneath your image. They favor those ads that look like ‘download’ or ‘start now’ buttons, and the ads sit right next to the images on the right, so it’s easy to get confused and click on the ad.</p><h2 id="5-Logaster-com"><a href="#5-Logaster-com" class="headerlink" title="5. Logaster.com"></a>5. Logaster.com</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>You’ll have to pay for larger images.</em></li><li><em>Focused more on businesses.</em></li><li><em>Incorporates your channel name.</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>Logaster is really a service for businesses – they make and sell business cards, letterheads, and other office-y things like that. However, they are still a good choice for YouTubers because they have a free logo creator. Sort of.</p><p>You actually have to pay $9.99 to get larger images and remove the watermark, but the process is free.</p><p>When you arrive on Logaster there’s a button right on their home page that says ‘Create a logo for free’. Click on it.</p><p>In Step 1 it’ll ask for your company name and an activity type. You just need to put in your channel name and choose something from the activity drop down that you focus on in your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/branding-icons-logos-on-logaster.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon on Logaster Start Window"                ></p><p>My heart burns with the secret desire to be YouTube’s Neil Degrasse Tyson (it doesn’t really, but he is super cool) so I tried ‘Katie Does Science’ and ‘Science, Studies, Education’. Here’s what it came up with:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/branding-icons-logos-suggestions-on-logaster.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Logo Icon on Logaster"                ></p><p><em>There are 10 pages of suggestions!</em></p><p>You can see how, unless you have a short channel name, you’re probably not going to be able to use any of these as an icon, but a lot of them would look cool on a banner. There’s an ‘Edit Logo Concept’ button which allows you to make changes to the layout, but you can still only choose from preset layouts. For example, some logo concepts allow you to choose whether the icon is above your text or next to it.</p><p>After you click ‘save’ in the last step you’ll be prompted to provide an email address and password. Once you sign in, you’ll be able to download a small logo for free, or purchase the higher resolution image.</p><p>I personally wouldn’t recommend buying an image from here unless your channel is for your small business and you need things like branded business cards and letterhead. This site might be better for gathering inspiration than actually downloading a logo from.</p><h2 id="6-Icons8-com"><a href="#6-Icons8-com" class="headerlink" title="6. Icons8.com"></a>6. Icons8.com</h2><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><em>You need to link back to them to use their icons.</em></li><li><em>You can edit the colors on the site and even add details.</em></li><li><em>There’s a size limit on the free service (100x100px)</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>At Icons8 they have free and paid services. If you download an icon for free it will be a PNG file (which should be fine, YouTube supports PNG and it’s good for transparency) that is no larger than 100x100px. This is not ideal since YouTube recommends 800x800px for profile pictures, but it’s not necessarily a deal breaker either. Profile pictures render down to much smaller than that.</p><p>You will also need to link to Icons8 if you use their icons for free (i.e. in the ‘about’ section of your channel page).</p><p>To get started on Icons8, type something into the search bar on the home page that you think might work as an icon or as part of whatever graphics you have planned. I typed in ‘game’ for this one, since gaming is the biggest genre on YouTube. Here are a few of the results that came up:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg"                      alt="Gaming Logo Icon on Icons8"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dR4tF3VgyU?si=AJipgqZsNNxsRsBW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Lower down in the results there were different kinds of sports balls, hand-held gaming systems, playing cards, joy sticks, baseball caps and more.</em></p><p>After you find an icon you like, click on it and it will appear on the right side of your screen where you’ll be able to make a few changes (an editing screen will pop up once you start clicking on things).

Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p><h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p><p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p><p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p><h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p><p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p><h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5aJC8okA8s?si=L2rnYAp-gmGlLQSf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p><h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p><h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p><h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p><h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p><p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p><h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p><p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p><p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p><p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p><p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aoMiYpYiFZs?si=qvYvGytDD17fvSXO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel"></a>Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>As we already noted you can either <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload a video to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly from a video editing software or from a hard drive after the rendering process is completed.

Creating a video in Filmora doesn’t require a developed set of video editing skills, since all of the tools and options the editor offers are remarkably easy to use.</p><p>When you are ready to start a new project you should simply launch the software, and once the new project loads, you should head over to the File menu and select the Project Settings option that lets you <strong>set the resolution, aspect ratio and the frame rate of the video.</strong> Proceed to import the footage into the project by selecting one of the available options in the Import drop-down menu or by simply dragging the media assets from a folder on your hard drive and dropping them to the Filmora’s Media Panel. In case you don’t have your own audio and video footage you can download videos, music, visual and audio effects from a stock footage website like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmstock effects store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Filmora also offers <strong>screen casting</strong> features, so you can easily <strong>record gameplay, show viewers how to use a software or capture any other type of activity on your computer’s screen.</strong></p><p>Add each media asset you want to include in the final cut of the video to the timeline and then proceed to remove all unwanted parts of the video and audio clips from the timeline using the Cut or Trim options. Filmora offers <strong>rich transitions and visual effects libraries</strong> you can use to make the cuts between shot smoother or enhance the colors in the video clips you’re editing. Furthermore, the editor lets you <strong>take snapshots of any frame in video clips</strong> you’ve placed on the timeline in a single click which can be quite useful if you want to create a thumbnail for your YouTube video. Creating the opening titles, end credits or adding different image overlays to a video is a straight forward process since you just have to select the option that fits the style of the video you’re creating and add it to the timeline. Once you’ve completed the video editing process, you can click on the Export button and decide if you want to export a video directly to your YouTube channel or to a destination on your hard drive.</p><p>New to Filmora?

Each step of the YouTube creation process is equally important, and you should dedicate an equal amount of attention to recording high-quality footage, editing, and promotion of the content you share on your YouTube channel.

These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and&#x2F;or products online.</p><p>However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> to prepare a video advertisement:</p><ul><li><strong>Logo</strong></li></ul><p>You must have a good-quality photo of your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >brand logo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.</p><ul><li><strong>HD Images</strong></li></ul><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.</p><ul><li><strong>Google Chrome Browser</strong></li></ul><p>You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Channel</strong></li></ul><p>Because <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Channel created <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability of the Tool and Features</strong></li></ul><p><strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer. However, this majorly depends on the region of your residence. As of now, the utility is not even available in some countries of the world.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Video-Builder-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Video-Builder-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?</h2><p>As explained earlier, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is an online tool that works on the latest version of the Google Chrome browser. The web interface of the utility has separate blocks (or placeholders if you want to call them) for different types of images. For instance, there is a placeholder for your logo, and a couple of other blank slots where you can import the photos from your computer.</p><p>There are some text input fields that you can populate with the relevant information such as the name of the video, the product’s name that you wish to promote, and many other things. There is a storyboard at the bottom of the interface that helps give your video a theme and the alignment of the ingredients that you have imported from your computer.</p><p>Finally, you can add background music to the video from the royalty-free tracks that can be accessed from the built-in library, and you are all set to go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AcAYRX0cwwA?si=DxqWU39vqksZbe1s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>Because YouTube Video Builder is in its Beta phase, at the time of this writing you are required to send an access request to Google using your account that you want to use to create the videos from.

Now the YouTube video editor is able to add video effects to the video and create multiple projects at the same time. While the editor can do more, it has stayed a simple tool.</p><p>This simplicity makes it very easy and quick to use. Unlike desktop editors, the YouTube Editor processes much faster. Since the tool is designed to be easy to use, you can learn to use the YouTube Editor in very little time. However, due to its simplicity, it does not offer all the same features. Some of the features that are missing means that it is not suited for every project.</p><h4 id="The-Basic-Features"><a href="#The-Basic-Features" class="headerlink" title="The Basic Features"></a><strong>The Basic Features</strong></h4><h4 id="1-The-editor"><a href="#1-The-editor" class="headerlink" title="1.The editor"></a>1.The editor</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-6.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Video Editor review and guide"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dn-24B6AURY?si=ErES2KWVnintY6h9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The YouTube Video Editor does come with some standard video editing functions like video splicing, Audioswap, and cropping videos. The video editor needs to have the videos already uploaded to YouTube. Along with using your own videos, you have the option to use videos that are part of the Creative Commons library. There transitions, and other features that other standard video editors have. Audioswap is easy to use, and there is access to the Creative Commons library in the editor.</p><h4 id="2-The-Enhancements"><a href="#2-The-Enhancements" class="headerlink" title="2.

Enhancements can be found by clicking on a video picture after it has been added to the project. Enhancements are broken into four categories: Quick Fixes, Filters, Text, and Audio. Quick fixes are basic adjustments for small issues like the contrast and saturation of the video. YouTube added an auto-fix button and stabilize video button to make it quick to fix these issues. The filters, text, and audio, are about the same that you would find with any other video editing software.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Want to know how to use the Enhancements feature in YouTube?

It is also super easy to learn. If you have a Google+ account, you can photos to your video straight from your cloud storage. You also have access to all the videos that you have uploaded to YouTube. All the features are easy to use, and many can be dragged and dropped making editing easy. Google is still improving the YouTube Video Editor to have more features and run smoother.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Want to know YouTube alternatives?

Another major con is that the video editor is fully online. This means that a refresh is needed to see the changes that you have made. After the refresh of the video, the video jumps back to the beginning of the video making it frustrating to edit the end of a video. There is also no real way of shortening music in the editor at the moment. Unlike many desk top video editors, you cannot overlap music or video clips. This means that some of the transitions are choppy.</p><h4 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h4><p>Since Google is still working on the YouTube Video Editor, hopefully, most of kinks will be worked out soon. While the YouTube Video Editor is getting better, it is still have the most basic features. The easy to use nature of the editor may mean that it stays more of a simple to use video tool. This does make it easy to edit, and it’s good for most projects. Millions of people use this editor because it is so easy to use. However, more advanced projects are still going to need a desktop video editor. We are hoping to see more advanced features in the future.</p><p>Many YouTubers and everyday people like the YouTube Video Editor, for its ease of use and the quick video editing that it provides. However, if it is right for you, depends greatly on what you are trying to do. If you plan on doing any editing past cropping videos, adding type and transitions, and switching music, you are better off using a desktop video editor. Hopefully, this YouTube Video Editor Review helps you figure out if YouTube’s editor is the right one of your projects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=heERQcpMi77lqToE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-complete-guide-to-generating-profits-vimeo-monetization-mastery/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Complete Guide to Generating Profits Vimeo Monetization Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/aptivate-audiences-quickly-shortcuts-for-youtube-trailers-with-filmora/"><u>[New] Captivate Audiences Quickly Shortcuts for YouTube Trailers with Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/bs-masterclass-for-beginners-stream-to-youtube-flawlessly/"><u>[New] OBS Masterclass for Beginners Stream to YouTube Flawlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-shining-up-your-android-videos-effortlessly/"><u>[New] Shining Up Your Android Videos Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-top-10-recruiting-gems-amp-up-engagement/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Top 10 Recruiting Gems Amp Up Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-guide-to-incorited-visuals-in-text-without-cost-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Guide to Incorited Visuals in Text Without Cost for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-guide-to-seamless-videos-with-funimate/"><u>[Updated] Guide to Seamless Videos with Funimate</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/sing-mr-beasts-monetary-trajectory-for-2024/"><u>Assessing Mr. Beast’s Monetary Trajectory for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-news.techidaily.com/ensuring-the-safety-of-your-virtual-currencies-expert-tips-from-yl-software/"><u>Ensuring the Safety of Your Virtual Currencies: Expert Tips From YL Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/top-10-leading-websites-a-comprehensive-ranking-of-global-internet-giants/"><u>Top 10 Leading Websites: A Comprehensive Ranking of Global Internet Giants</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.</p><p>When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Be-Authentic"><a href="#1-Be-Authentic" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Authentic"></a><strong>1. Be Authentic</strong></h2><p>People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.</p><p>Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pSRlspzW-A?si=A82G3Yxwj_31cKDq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Tell-A-Story"><a href="#2-Tell-A-Story" class="headerlink" title="2. Tell A Story"></a><strong>2. Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zWYVKFk3yPQ?si=Yu7xsjIYgRiq8zHk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience"></a><strong>3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience</strong></h2><p>There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html" >surprising, yet inevitable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.</p><p>The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat’s bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hpne0zPsZwU?si=yN5QDsG_WLb_Y3u-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Be-Inviting"><a href="#4-Be-Inviting" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Inviting"></a><strong>4. Be Inviting</strong></h2><p>A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.</p><p>Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.</p><p>The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Compose-the-Shot"><a href="#5-Compose-the-Shot" class="headerlink" title="5. Compose the Shot"></a><strong>5. Compose the Shot</strong></h2><p>Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.</p><p>In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.</p><p>The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the basics of video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Check out this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q" >Rosanna Pansino <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where she gives a tour of her bedroom.</p><p> The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to. Don’t hesitate to let the viewer know what you want them to see.</p><h2 id="6-Be-Prepared"><a href="#6-Be-Prepared" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Prepared"></a><strong>6. Be Prepared</strong></h2><p>While you can pick up a camera and start vlogging on the fly, being prepared enables you to produce the best video possible. Take a few minutes before you hit record simply to outline the key points you want to talk about and how the video will end, ensuring that after filming you haven’t forgotten a crucial part.</p><p>Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…</p><p>Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.</p><p>Take a look at <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w" >Ashley Nichole <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BmegThMdrJE?si=rILo1FJb9DgnPljV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Be-Expressive"><a href="#7-Be-Expressive" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Expressive"></a><strong>7. Be Expressive</strong></h2><p>Remember those teachers that drone on and on, without adding any expression or passion to what they are lecturing? While they might have been perfectly suitable as teachers, they wouldn’t make good vloggers.</p><p>If you speak on camera in a monotone voice, you are not being expressive. Your facial and body language will match your lackluster performance. Even if you are talking about something you are excited about, if your demeanor doesn’t match that, then the video is going to be lifeless. Vlogging is a presentation, a performance. There needs to be energy.</p><p>Consider your audience: they are coming home from school or work, where there were classes and meetings, and the last thing they want to watch is a video of your speaking without energy.</p><p>Want to see a vlogger that is awesome at being expressive on camera? Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg" >Emma Chamberlain <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, if you haven’t already. Every word she says in her video is layered with emotion. We know exactly how she feels.</p><h2 id="8-Stay-Organized"><a href="#8-Stay-Organized" class="headerlink" title="8. Stay Organized"></a><strong>8. Stay Organized</strong></h2><p>The same way you should prepare before filming, it’s also important to be organized comes the editing phase. Editing is arguably the most time-consuming part of the vlogging process, so have a system for categorizing and finding your footages.</p><p>This is especially important when you have multiple video and audio files and if you are capturing footage over a number of days or in different locations.</p><p>Additionally, while filming your vlog, you are going to mess up. It’s also helpful to add a cue after you messed up, this can be a sound cue that causes the levels to spike (clapping or snapping your fingers work) or a video cue such as a dramatic gesture to the camera. When skipping through your footage to find the part where you messed up, later on, it’s easier to have a mark to help you locate it.</p><p>Vlogging is hard, so don’t make more work for yourself. Learn little tricks to make life easier for yourself at every step.</p><p>The more organized you are the more attention you can put into the creative aspect of vlogging, and less time finding a video file or syncing audio to video.</p><p>There you have it, 8 tips to help you vlog like the pros. Anyone can vlog. But only until you point a camera at yourself in public for the first time, do you realize how uncomfortable vlogging can be.</p><p>Even filming yourself in your room with the door closed — and nobody is in the house with you — can be a challenge for beginning vloggers. If you find watching your first few videos to be cringy, don’t be discouraged. There are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >fears of vlogging, but you can overcome them <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Take a look at some of the <a class="link"   href="http://tubularinsights.com/throwback-thursday-first-videos-from-youtubes-top-stars/" >first videos from popular YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can see that everyone had a starting point.</p><p>Do you have any vlogging tricks of your own?

Having an instantaneous conversation with a viewer while they are watching your video will encourage more engagement and establish a ber relationship with your viewers — and you will know that these viewers are not bots.</p><h4 id="Increase-watch-time-and-session-watch-time-on-your-channel"><a href="#Increase-watch-time-and-session-watch-time-on-your-channel" class="headerlink" title="Increase watch time and session watch time on your channel"></a>Increase watch time and session watch time on your channel</h4><p>If you are making YouTube videos on average 10 minutes long, and the viewer only watches half of it, that’s only 5 minutes of watch time, which is fine… But if you are live streaming for 45 minutes, and you are able to hold the viewer’s attention, you can surpass what your regular videos can do.</p><h4 id="Make-videos-faster"><a href="#Make-videos-faster" class="headerlink" title="Make videos faster"></a>Make videos faster</h4><p>As a YouTuber, you are always striving to be more efficient. Live streaming allows you to do that as you can set up and go. The content you end up creating during the duration of your livestream can then also be condensed into a highlight reel or a recap.</p><p>With a bit of planning before you go live, you can create a week’s worth of content in one go, instead of having multiple schedules for livestream content and your standard publishing videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y3VlwHTQQMs?si=BXYwD1pKiaTuev4y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Type-of-Content-to-Livestream"><a href="#Type-of-Content-to-Livestream" class="headerlink" title="Type of Content to Livestream"></a>Type of Content to Livestream</h2><p>Live streaming has a lot of value, but what type of content should you be streaming?</p><p>Here are a few popular ideas for content that will attract viewers to your livestream:</p><h4 id="Q-A-session"><a href="#Q-A-session" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A session"></a><strong>Q&amp;A session</strong></h4><h4 id="Unboxing"><a href="#Unboxing" class="headerlink" title="Unboxing"></a><strong>Unboxing</strong></h4><h4 id="Game-or-challenge"><a href="#Game-or-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Game or challenge"></a><strong>Game or challenge</strong></h4><h4 id="Sneak-preview-or-review"><a href="#Sneak-preview-or-review" class="headerlink" title="Sneak preview or review"></a><strong>Sneak preview or review</strong></h4><h4 id="Live-events-just-make-sure-the-Internet-can-support-it"><a href="#Live-events-just-make-sure-the-Internet-can-support-it" class="headerlink" title="Live events (just make sure the Internet can support it)"></a><strong>Live events</strong> (just make sure the Internet can support it)</h4><h4 id="A-demo-or-a-tutorial"><a href="#A-demo-or-a-tutorial" class="headerlink" title="A demo or a tutorial"></a><strong>A demo or a tutorial</strong></h4><h4 id="A-live-commentary-or-if-you-are-a-gamer-Let’s-Play-video"><a href="#A-live-commentary-or-if-you-are-a-gamer-Let’s-Play-video" class="headerlink" title="A live commentary or (if you are a gamer) Let’s Play video"></a><strong>A live commentary or (if you are a gamer) Let’s Play video</strong></h4><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/td3ojuzhloY?si=N_maQNiJWrJp7XZl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-You-Need-to-Livestream-On-YouTube"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Livestream-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Livestream On YouTube"></a>What You Need to Livestream On YouTube</h2><h4 id="A-Plan-or-Outline"><a href="#A-Plan-or-Outline" class="headerlink" title="A Plan or Outline"></a>A Plan or Outline</h4><p>It’s good to know what your livestream is going to be about before you start. Is there a key message you want to hit, an action you want your viewers to take, or a structure you want to follow.</p><p>Just because it’s live, doesn’t mean it all has to be improvised. If you go in without a plan, you might end up feeling flustered or getting stressed out. Allow for spontaneous comments or events to take you off your initial plan, but always return to your outline so you know how to wrap up your livestream when you have to.</p><h4 id="Stable-Internet-Connection"><a href="#Stable-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Stable Internet Connection"></a>Stable Internet Connection</h4><p>You cannot conduct a quality livestream, if your Internet is bad. When evaluating your internet connection for live streaming on YouTube, look at the Upload speed. Depending on the quality of your video, these are the minimum upload speed rates your Internet will need to perform:</p><p>480p &#x3D; 1.5 mbps</p><p>720p &#x3D; 3 mbps</p><p>1080 &#x3D; 5 mbps</p><p>In addition, be aware of external causes that may be slowing down your internet such as someone else using it, a poorly performing router, or a damaged cable.</p><h4 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h4><p>If you have a smartphone or a laptop with a webcam built in, that is the best camera for you to get started live streaming. It’s good to have a milestone and work towards a more advanced camera, but until then, don’t feel discouraged because you don’t have expensive gear. If you have a smartphone, a laptop, or a basic webcam, that’s perfectly fine.</p><h4 id="Microphone"><a href="#Microphone" class="headerlink" title="Microphone"></a>Microphone</h4><p>You don’t need a great microphone for live streaming, you only need a good one. If you do want to spend several hundred to a thousand dollars for a professional studio microphone, nobody will stop you, but know this, a mic that is easy to use is as important as the audio quality as you develop a consistent live streaming schedule.</p><h4 id="Streaming-Software-For-Higher-Quality-Streams"><a href="#Streaming-Software-For-Higher-Quality-Streams" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Software (For Higher Quality Streams)"></a>Streaming Software (For Higher Quality Streams)</h4><p>Once upon a time, to livestream on YouTube, you needed additional software to capture content from desktop, camera, microphone, etc, called encoding software — but not anymore.</p><p>Those encoding software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wirecast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >VMix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, are required if you are producing content that requires a high frame rate such as gaming, but not mandatory if you are simply vlogging or running a tutorial.</p><p>If you are using Chrome, you can <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/youtube-rolls-out-a-new-feature-that-lets-you-go-live-from-the-desktop-without-an-encoder/" >stream live on YouTube without using an encoder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="A-Capture-Card-For-Higher-Quality-Streams"><a href="#A-Capture-Card-For-Higher-Quality-Streams" class="headerlink" title="A Capture Card (For Higher Quality Streams)"></a>A Capture Card (For Higher Quality Streams)</h4><p>You will need a capture card when you are capturing footage from a different PC or console. If you are a gamer and you are using one PC to stream and one PC to play your game, then you should consider getting a capture card.</p><h2 id="4-Ways-to-Setup-Your-Livestream-On-YouTube"><a href="#4-Ways-to-Setup-Your-Livestream-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube"></a>4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube</h2><p>There are 4 main ways you can start live streaming on YouTube. The one that works best for you depends on the content you are going to be streaming.</p><h4 id="1-Camera-Go-Live-Chrome-Browser"><a href="#1-Camera-Go-Live-Chrome-Browser" class="headerlink" title="1. Camera&#x2F;Go Live (Chrome Browser)"></a>1. Camera&#x2F;Go Live (Chrome Browser)</h4><p>By accessing <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/webcam" >www.youtube.com/webcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the Google Chrome browser, you can start streaming immediately through your connected webcam. This way is best for a simple Q&amp;A or letting your viewers know your thoughts in a timely situation. This method does not require an encoder.</p><p> There are 3 ways to access livestream this way:</p><p>1. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/webcam"><strong>here</strong></a> to connect to your YouTube channel</p><p>2. You can access it from the top menu on YouTube</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/access-livestream1.jpg"                      alt="access livestream"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aoMiYpYiFZs?si=qvYvGytDD17fvSXO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>3. You can access it by clicking Camera under the Live Streaming tab in your Creator Studio</p><h4 id="2-Google-Hangouts-On-Air-Quick"><a href="#2-Google-Hangouts-On-Air-Quick" class="headerlink" title="2. Google Hangouts On Air (Quick)"></a><strong>2. Google Hangouts On Air (Quick)</strong></h4><p>Another way to livestream without an encoding software is by using the Google Hangouts On Air feature.</p><p>This is great if you want the feel of your livestream to be similar to a board meeting, where you can invite people, split screen, and share screen to illustrate your point.</p><p>Here’s how you can access this Google Hangouts On Air:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Events under the Live Streaming tab in your Creator Studio</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click New Live Event button on the top right corner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-live-event-button2.jpg"                      alt="new live event button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMS5pm0SQlQ?si=gasOo6p2agrVlIb7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the event’s Info and Setting page. Fill out the details of your Livestream, and under Type, select <strong>Quick</strong> (using Google Hangouts On Air).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-event-info-and-setting3.jpg"                      alt="new event info and setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can schedule your livestream or Go Live immediately by clicking one of the blue buttons on the left-hand side.</p><h4 id="3-Mobile"><a href="#3-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="3. Mobile"></a><strong>3. Mobile</strong></h4><p>Live streaming via your mobile device gives you a lot more freedom to maneuver. You can walk around and give your viewers a tour — but remember to stay within the WiFi or LTE range. That means you still won’t be able to livestream well inside an elevator.</p><p>Here’s how you can livestream on mobile:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the YouTube app and make sure you are signed in to the account you want to livestream from.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: At the top, click on the camera icon</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click on Go Live</p><p>  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When live streaming, always hold your smartphone horizontally. This allows your video to be oriented as a landscape, instead of a portrait.</p><h4 id="4-Custom-Encoder"><a href="#4-Custom-Encoder" class="headerlink" title="4. Custom Encoder"></a><strong>4. Custom Encoder</strong></h4><p>The fourth way of live streaming on YouTube is with encoding software. This is the recommended method if video quality is essential, such as gaming videos.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install an encoding software. In this example, we’ll be using <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Open OBS</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Go to YouTube Creator Studio and enter the Stream Now page</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-studio4.jpg"                      alt="youtube creator studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Under Encoder Setup, copy Stream name&#x2F;key (Warning: DO NOT share this key with anyone)</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Return to OBS and enter the Setting menu on the lower right-hand side of the application</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click into the Stream tab</p><p>a) Under Stream Type, select Streaming Services</p><p>b) Under Service, select YouTube&#x2F;YouTube Gaming</p><p>c) Under Server, select Primary YouTube ingest server</p><p>d) In Stream Key box, paste the Stream Key you copied from YouTube</p><p>e) Click Apply and then OK</p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Plug in your webcam</p><p><strong>Step 8</strong>: In the main OBS dashboard, under the Sources menu, click the + icon and add Video Capture Device. You should now see visuals from your Webcam.</p><p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Select the Resolution you want for your video and click OK</p><p><strong>Step 10</strong>: Return to your YouTube Streaming Page and fill out the details of your livestream</p><p><strong>Step 11</strong>: Go back to OBS and click Start Streaming</p><p><strong>Step 12</strong>: See on YouTube Streaming Page at the top that you are Live. You are officially streaming. Once You are finished streaming, return to OBS and click Stop Streaming to end the stream.</p><h2 id="8-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Livestream-on-YouTube"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Livestream-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Improve Your Livestream on YouTube"></a>8 Tips to Improve Your Livestream on YouTube</h2><h4 id="Do-Speed-Test"><a href="#Do-Speed-Test" class="headerlink" title="Do Speed Test"></a>Do Speed Test</h4><p>Before you start your livestream, do a speed test of your Internet. Check out from <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><h4 id="Have-Good-Lighting"><a href="#Have-Good-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Have Good Lighting"></a>Have Good Lighting</h4><p>Be aware of your surroundings when you are about to livestream. You don’t need the top-notch lighting kit, you can simply sit beside a window and allow natural lights to illuminate your stream.</p><h4 id="Shoot-A-Live-Test-Unlisted"><a href="#Shoot-A-Live-Test-Unlisted" class="headerlink" title="Shoot A Live Test (Unlisted)"></a>Shoot A Live Test (Unlisted)</h4><p>Have a technical rehearsal by doing a livestream test, then rewatching it, and evaluating the quality of the audio and visual.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about your audience logging in and seeing your test if you set the Privacy of the stream to Unlisted.</p><h4 id="Look-at-the-Lens-Not-the-Screen"><a href="#Look-at-the-Lens-Not-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Look at the Lens, Not the Screen"></a>Look at the Lens, Not the Screen</h4><p>If you are streaming with the selfie camera on your smartphone or using your camera’s viewfinder to make sure you are in the frame, remember that you need to be looking at the lens — not the image of yourself.</p><p>Eye contact is important in building trust, and if you are looking at yourself, it will appear as if you are looking past your viewers instead of at them.</p><h4 id="Show-It-To-Your-Viewers"><a href="#Show-It-To-Your-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="Show It To Your Viewers"></a>Show It To Your Viewers</h4><p>Whatever you are talking about, if you can, show it to your viewers. YouTube is a visual medium, and that means your viewers can become disinterested if there’s nothing visual holding their attention.</p><p>In the beginning, you probably won’t have a multi-camera setup, so you cannot cut away from your livestream. However, you can share the screen and you can bring physical objects into a frame.</p><p>If you are talking about your dog, show her on camera. If you’re presenting something with a lot of steps, create a Powerpoint slideshow.</p><p>Consider what visuals or props you can add to your livestream to enhance your performance.</p><h4 id="Find-A-Way-to-Make-it-Evergreen"><a href="#Find-A-Way-to-Make-it-Evergreen" class="headerlink" title="Find A Way to Make it Evergreen"></a>Find A Way to Make it Evergreen</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing" >Evergreen content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> refers to content that is relevant for a great length of time. Talking about an event isn’t evergreen, because the event will soon pass and become old news. However, giving some tips for how to plan an event would be evergreen content.</p><p>Since your livestream will be saved on YouTube and your viewers can replay and watch it. They’re more likely to enjoy it if the content is relevant and interesting.</p><h4 id="It-Doesn’t-Have-to-Be-Long"><a href="#It-Doesn’t-Have-to-Be-Long" class="headerlink" title="It Doesn’t Have to Be Long"></a>It Doesn’t Have to Be Long</h4><p>A livestream doesn’t need to be 40 minutes long. It only needs to be long enough for you to get your story across — and if you want to answer some questions and engage with your audience. As soon as your story is over, even if it’s only 5 minutes, that’s okay. Don’t stress about the length of your stream, it’s not an endurance competition.</p><h4 id="Allow-Yourself-to-Make-Mistakes"><a href="#Allow-Yourself-to-Make-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Allow Yourself to Make Mistakes"></a>Allow Yourself to Make Mistakes</h4><p>Another thing you shouldn’t worry about at all is making mistakes. When you are doing livestreams pretend you are engaging with someone in real life. In real life, you aren’t able to edit out your mistakes, whether it’s a word mispronounced or coffee spilling. Roll with it and laugh it off.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/58KlTPHv8dU?si=7ICagyNgrao7OkVO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Grow-As-A-Livestreamer-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Grow-As-A-Livestreamer-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube"></a>How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube</h2><h4 id="Let-People-Know-When-You-Are-Streaming"><a href="#Let-People-Know-When-You-Are-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="Let People Know When You Are Streaming"></a>Let People Know When You Are Streaming</h4><p>Give people enough time to schedule it in, don’t spring it on them in the last minute.

The look is highly inspirational in itself. The vintage effect in photography and videos results in a must-see look that everyone wants to capture all day long. The meaning of vintage is ‘the time when something of quality was produced.’ When something is called retro, it means old, recognized, and essential. Vintage also resembles love apart from videos and photos. All in all, it’s a positive and result-oriented thing to carry on in your videos. And this is what we want to mention in this post relating to the creation of vintage videos.</p><p>Here are some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >vintage-style video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you to have a look at.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYH0B2HqcIM?si=3fkoG85L6hAeB4ok" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Consider-When-Shooting-a-Vintage-Video"><a href="#What-to-Consider-When-Shooting-a-Vintage-Video" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?"></a>What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?</h2><p>Vintage videos are kind of old school vibes and must be shooting accordingly by keeping in mind the following points. These are a sort of expert tips given by photographers based on their practical experience. First of all, you have to understand that a video can be made vintage, but you can’t change the actual environment of shooting. Some editing always involves there in every project out there. Still, the tips given below will help you a lot in creating a retro look.</p><h4 id="Use-Vintage-Lenses"><a href="#Use-Vintage-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Use Vintage Lenses"></a>Use Vintage Lenses</h4><p>The very first helpful tip is to use a vintage lens. They allow chromatic aberration by distorting colors around the frame. Furthermore, you can find various kinds of lenses in terms of a vintage effect.</p><h4 id="Decrease-Contrast"><a href="#Decrease-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="Decrease Contrast"></a>Decrease Contrast</h4><p>Do the correct color grading by reducing the contrast a little bit. You must not level the retro videos in black or white or like-new videos. You can simply add a contrasting effect and then reduce it to have that vintage look.</p><h4 id="Keep-it-a-little-soft"><a href="#Keep-it-a-little-soft" class="headerlink" title="Keep it a little soft"></a>Keep it a little soft</h4><p>If you have ever noticed, the vintage videos are a little soft and look like degraded with time. It’s a result of decreased sharpness in the camera’s menu settings. You can even add a slight blur to the final video or simply use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >recognized software made for video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Brighten-up-the-black-levels"><a href="#Brighten-up-the-black-levels" class="headerlink" title="Brighten up the black levels"></a>Brighten up the black levels</h4><p>Lots of black points in the video are not ideal for a vintage effect. The suitable approach is to bring up black levels and make it dark gray instead of inky black. This look can be achieved either by levels effect or curves effect in your editing software.</p><h4 id="Reduce-Saturation-levels"><a href="#Reduce-Saturation-levels" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Saturation levels"></a>Reduce Saturation levels</h4><p>Bringing down the saturation levels is another tip to create a vintage effect. The old videos are also absent in bright colors. Don’t go too crazy about reduction as 20%-30% saturation level is more than enough.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?"></a>How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?</h2><p>What you need to get started as both beginner and professional is Wondershare Filmora Video Editor. It is a highly recommended software to create vintage videos. The intuitive user interface and lots of editing functions are helpful for a video editor. It has both primary as well as advanced editing programs to check. It has various advanced color tuning tools to promote the making of original videos. It features tint, temperature, Vignette, 3D Luts, Lights, and so on.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Steps for the vintage effect to videos on Wondershare Filmora Video Editor</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Upload video &amp; make specific changes</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-1.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>The very step is to add the video by clicking the + icon. We have added the three <strong>sample videos</strong> from the library of Wondershare Filmora itself. Adjust them in the timeline as per your requirements.</p><p>After doing all the essential editing functions, click on the <strong>Effects tab</strong> given at the upper-left corner. Simply type the word Old in the Search tab.</p><p>The Old Video filter will immediately appear in the list of filters. Tap the <strong>“+”</strong> icon in Old Video filter to add to the timeline. Drag its ends right or left to adjust the duration.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply White &amp; Black Filters</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-2.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jng92DT1n_Y?si=EdMRoNAFi0Q6mP7G" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The second step is to apply the Black &amp; White filters. Go to the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and explore five Black &amp; White filters available. Each of these filters is quite different and must be applied accordingly. Check the aesthetic of your video clip before any filter application to retro videos.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the Sun Kissed or Sepia Tone Rise Filters to the video clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-3.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>There are various other categories of filters you can apply, such as Retro, Sun Kissed, and Sepia Tone, etc. The features of Filmora also present several subcategories such as Faux Film or Shake.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-4.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>On the other hand, the subcategory of Sepia Tone features Sun-Kissed &amp; Rise Filters to stimulate sepia-tinted texture and recreate the old visual style. The Sun Kissed filter presents brown and red colors to give that warm image atmosphere.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Desaturate Video Clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-5.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Now, you need to desaturate the video clip with Ash &amp; Willow filters. We have typed Ash in the Search bar, and you can see the filter below. These filters are essential to desaturate the video with preset contrast, brightness, or exposure values.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-6.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Then, we have combined the black &amp; white filter with an overlay of Film Reel Horizontal. It will help you sell the effect and make the video look more authentic. However, the only application of Black &amp; White or Ash &amp; Willow filters is not going to make any creative thing in terms of vintage videos. You have to mix overlays with features such as Random Dust or Film Reel Horizontal.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Apply Black &amp; White and Old Film Color Correction Presets to the video</p><p>You can also access the Advanced color correction Tab of Filmora from the Color button. It also features Preset and Adjusts Tabs to desaturate footage. The Preset presents a variety of options, including Black &amp; White and Old Film. You just need to right-click the particular preset and select the Apply option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-advance-color-correction.jpg"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-G7cU8dYvuI?si=JaKqRcW6qq9CDvty" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-to-Make-Your-Vintage-Videos-Stand-Out"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Your-Vintage-Videos-Stand-Out" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out"></a>Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out</h2><p>Following the helpful tips would assist you in creating awesome retro videos.</p><ul><li>You can use various vintage apps such as <strong>Retro VHS</strong>, <strong>RTRO Camera</strong>, <strong>8mm</strong>, <strong>Camcorder</strong>, <strong>VSCO</strong>, etc. Or, despite using these limited apps, you can directly use our preferred video editing software called <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.</li><li>If you use a specific vintage camera, keep it on low highlights and low contrasts. Use color grading, as we have discussed above. They help to provide the ultimate old-school effect.</li><li>Always keep low saturation settings for shooting vintage videos. Take control over Saturation, Hue, and <strong>Luminance</strong> of video.</li><li>Add overlays and respective filters to recreate a required vintage look. You must add things that dust, scratch, and grain the heck out from the video that you have created.</li><li>Lower the frame rate or FPS to create an excellent vintage look. You can make it to 18 or 14 FPS depending upon the aesthetic requirements.</li><li>Keep an eye on black and white filters you have used. It’s because more of a black and white can ruin the actual vintage experience.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzb-0C0xUYA?si=F4MPhdVqyVgx7_8X" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>So, this is an ultimate tutorial on the creation of vintage videos.

Be Specific About Your YouTube Posting Schedule"></a>1. Be Specific About Your YouTube Posting Schedule</h2><p>Don’t just say you’re going to post a new video every week, decide on a specific day and time. If your subscribers expect new posts from you Thursdays at 4 pm, they will check your channel for those new posts every Thursday at 4 pm. This will make it easier for you to keep your view count close to your subscriber count.</p><p>The other benefit of being specific about your posting time is that the more specific you are, the less wiggle room you give yourself. Setting a clear deadline with yourself makes it harder to procrastinate.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OxkndZbIA4?si=TWJlkTbYKsVag8-q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Make-Your-YouTube-Upload-Schedule-Public"><a href="#2-Make-Your-YouTube-Upload-Schedule-Public" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Your YouTube Upload Schedule Public"></a>2. Make Your YouTube Upload Schedule Public</h2><p>Post your schedule somewhere potential subscribers can see it like in your channel banner, intro, or video descriptions. The reason schedules work as a tool for growth is that they allow your audience to build up anticipation. It will be easier for newcomers to your channel to feel that anticipation if you start setting expectations for them on their first visit.</p><p>Committing publicly to a posting schedule means making a promise to your viewers. If you break that promise, they will be disappointed. This social pressure should help to keep you posting consistently.</p><h2 id="3-Remember-That-Posting-on-YouTube-Takes-Time"><a href="#3-Remember-That-Posting-on-YouTube-Takes-Time" class="headerlink" title="3. Remember That Posting on YouTube Takes Time"></a>3. Remember That Posting on YouTube Takes Time</h2><p>When you decide what day you want to post on, make sure that it’s a day where you have a lot of time to spend on things like writing your description, promoting your video, and answering comments.</p><p>It might be helpful to set a private deadline for yourself the day before your official post to upload your video and enter all of your metadata (title, description, tags). Then you can keep the video private until it’s time to post.

Bank YouTube Videos"></a>4. Bank YouTube Videos</h2><p>It might happen that one week you’re full of ideas and energy and making videos is a breeze. It can be tempting to abandon your schedule and post more than normal, but you should resist that urge. Don’t waste all that energy – make the videos – but instead of posting them all right away, you should save them for weeks where you aren’t feeling the same enthusiasm.</p><h2 id="5-Set-Realistic-Goals"><a href="#5-Set-Realistic-Goals" class="headerlink" title="5. Set Realistic Goals"></a>5. Set Realistic Goals</h2><p>Your schedule shouldn’t leave you feeling burnt out. When you’re coming up with your schedule, think realistically about how much time you have to devote to YouTube and how much time you need to spend on a video. Give yourself enough time that you can keep to your schedule without feeling rushed.</p><p>Never make your schedule based on what other YouTubers are doing. Your lives are different.</p><p>Posting once a week is a good standard schedule, but if you like to spend a lot of time editing your videos and you work full time then maybe once a week isn’t realistic for you. Maybe you should post once every two weeks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBN1gYY5hUs?si=p89CMiMzeJzU0wGu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Best-Days-and-Times-to-Post-to-YouTube"><a href="#The-Best-Days-and-Times-to-Post-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Best Days and Times to Post to YouTube"></a>The Best Days and Times to Post to YouTube</h2><p>The best times to post are <strong>Thursdays</strong> and <strong>Fridays</strong> between 12 and 3pm (in the time zone of the majority of your subscribers – just check analytics in your Creator Studio).
