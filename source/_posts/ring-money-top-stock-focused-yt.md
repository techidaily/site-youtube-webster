By going through his first videos, you'll get a general idea of the basics of how to approach the stock market in 2022\. He advocates more long-term investments and because he's located in the United States, most of the information about stocks is about U.S. stocks. This is not necessarily a bad thing as many of the largest companies in the world trade in the U.S. stock market. He's very reciprocal and willing to share new ideas with his members.
