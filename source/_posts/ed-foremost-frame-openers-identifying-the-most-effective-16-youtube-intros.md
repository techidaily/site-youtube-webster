A high-quality YouTube intro is the short clip at the beginning of a YouTube video that introduces the topic and, usually, the vlogger. **YouTube intro videos** usually include things like the name of your channel and your logo if you have one. The colors, music, and graphics you use in your intro should all be related to the theme and tone of your vlog.

Your intro is your chance to make a great first impression. A good one lets viewers know what kind of experience they can expect to have if they keep watching your video – whether it’s going to be funny or serious, for example. Having an awesome YouTube intro sequence also helps make your vlog look more like a real show instead of somebody just ranting at their webcam (not that you cannot make a great video that way!).

Luckily, making a sleek, professional-looking YouTube intro is easy. There are a lot of sites that offer template videos that are either very affordable or completely free. Or, you can make your own intro in your video editing program. In this article, you will learn how to make YouTube intros easily with Filmora. In the end, you will also know the best tools to make intros for YouTube.

## Part 1: What Makes Excellent YouTube Intros

Before you are making intros for YouTube, you should know the metrics of making a high-quality YouTube intro. Now, let's take a look at these important ingredients.

### 1\. Keep It Relevant

If your intro doesn’t fit in with the content that follows it people will get confused. Then probably, they will close your video. So your intros must be relevant to your video type. Funny YouTube intros for interesting lifestyle videos. High tech intros for reviews.

### 2\. Keep It Short

if it lasts too long people will get bored and click away. Five seconds is the ideal length. It can be shorter, but only once your channel gains some popularity and you need the intro less. You always need to remember to capture the viewer's attention first.

In this part, we'll share 5 ways to make your YouTube intro awesome.

**1\. Keep It Under 10 Seconds**

A 10-second intro should have lots of movement and exciting music to hold viewers’ attention. If your intro is more subdued then aim for more than 5 seconds.

**2\. Support Your Brand**

One of the most important things your intro can do is strengthen your personal brand. Your intro should look related to your channel art and video thumbnails, but even beyond that, it should match the tone of your content.

**3\. Use Music**

When there’s a silent pause in your video the chances of viewers clicking away increase. Make sure your intro includes music that suits the tone of your channel.

**4\. Include Your Channel Name**

Your channel name should be a huge, prominent, visual in your intro. This may seem like a given, but there are intros out there where the channel name is either small easy to overlook, or left out completely in favor of a logo.

**5\. Do a Cold Open**

On TV, shows usually have at least one scene before they play the theme song. That’s because nobody is tuning in just for the theme, or in your case the intro. Make sure you have at least a short clip before your intro to get viewers interested in the rest of your video. Beyond setting the tone for the rest of the video and introducing your topic, you can use this first clip to create a ‘curiosity gap’. This means generating curiosity and making your viewers feel invested in the video so they stay on the page.
