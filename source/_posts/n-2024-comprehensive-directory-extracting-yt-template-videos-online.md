## Top Online Platforms for Downloading YouTube Intro Templates

Video editing professionals use stock websites and online video editing platforms for a variety of reasons that range from obtaining complementary footage for their projects to discovering templates and other animation graphics. YouTube intro templates that are available on these websites are not compatible with all video editing, animation, motion graphics, and compositing software products. Here are some of the most reliable online sources that offer a wide variety of mesmerizing YouTube intro templates.

#### 1. [Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Price:** Free version available, subscription plans start at $9.99 per month

The Wondersahre’s stock footage platform offers a plethora of visual and audio effects, music, videos, and YouTube intro templates. In addition, Filmstock lets you choose from packs like Urban Opener, Dynamic Intro or Fast Pop that fit various visual styles of YouTube videos. You can use Filmostocks for free, but if you opt for this option you won’t have access to the media assets stored in the platform’s Standard Library. On the other hand, purchasing the Premium subscription plan enables you to download twenty premium assets per month and to discover new intros, effects or stock footage each day. Filmostocks is a great choice for all YouTubers who edit their videos with Filmora or other versions of this video editing software as well as Adobe After Effects.
