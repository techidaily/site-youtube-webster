## Tips on Making Your ASMR Videos Stand Out

Were you much moved by the concept of ASMR videos and artists? Are you eager as well to land a step on this latest trending sensation of ASMR? Here are some ways that can make your ASMR video stand out from the crowd.

#### 1\. Come up with a non-original content

If you are a newbie to the ASMR floor, rather than coming up with your original content, surf over the previous videos by ASMR artists. Find the popular topic, like the cranial nerve exam, hair-salon, policeman catching thieves, and doctor role-play. Gain experience from such unique ideas and give it a try before experimenting with your original content to attract a small audience.

#### 2\. Be natural

The most critical factor in creating an ASMR video is to be realistic all the time. If you observe the strategy used by ASMR artists, they use objects, tap it, and bring out new sounds that attract the audience. Similarly, you can use items as triggers to make the video enhancing or effective.

#### 3\. Be interactive

Want more subscribers towards your channel? The audiences always like the more interactive videos and the artists who have a good relationship with them. Alongside, people with insomnia and loneliness also surf for the ASMR videos that can offer a little relief where being interactive can drive personal attention.

#### 4\. Get a friend to accompany you

If it is your first ASMR video, and you are not sure how to proceed, you can get assistance from your friend who has prior experience in it. You can also incorporate them while making a video. Doing so will reduce your insecurity in-camera exposure.

#### 5\. Film videos at night

This option might sound crazy, but it’s true as you will not have a distraction like traffic, cars, dogs, people conversations, and loud noise that might affect the video quality.

#### 6\. Be proud

ASMR is becoming a growing trend, as said before, and it is a sensational topic. If you have decided to travel in that path, it is fair but think twice before you step into it. Do not feel embarrassed or discouraged if you get any negative comments. Tell yourself that you are making something useful to help someone.
