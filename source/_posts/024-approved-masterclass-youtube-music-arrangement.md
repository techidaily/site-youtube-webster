### Three Ways Of YouTube Music Mix

YouTube has popularized three personalized mixes to keep you up-to-date on newly released music and introduce more artists to you:

**New Release Mix:** In the New Release Mix playlist, you can find all the newest tracks from your favorite artists, and some music is recommended. New updates are provided every Friday (when most new releases come out), and mid-week releases the entire week to ensure you're always up-to-date on the latest music.

**Your Mix:** Your Mix is a playlist full of songs by popular and well-known artists, as well as some new tunes and performers you've never discovered before, which are recommended based on your preferences, making it ideal for unwinding and listening to something you're guaranteed to love. The playlist is updated regularly, so the music never gets dull, and there's always something new to listen to.

### What Is YouTube Music Replay Mix?

You can access it by tapping the **"Replay Mix"** option on the YouTube app's main screen or the [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) website. This feature is perfect for those who want a continuously updated mix of their favorite songs.
