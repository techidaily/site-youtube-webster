### Part 3\. How To Shuffle YouTube Playlist on TV?

The YouTube app is also available on smart TVs, which many people find to be a more enjoyable experience than watching YouTube videos on a small screen.

However, unfortunately, there is no way to shuffle a YouTube playlist on a Smart TV. This is a feature that is currently only available on the YouTube website and apps.

But if your Smart TV comes with a built-in Chromecast option, you can screen mirror the YouTube app on your TV and shuffle the playlist to your liking in the following way:

**Step 1**: In the first step, make sure your Smart TV and mobile device are connected to the same internet connection.

**Step 2:** In the next step, launch the YouTube app on your device, and access your playlist under the **"Library"** tab. Tap the **"Shuffle"** icon in the playlist details section and play your playlist

**Step 3**: In the final step, tap the **"Cast"** icon at the top-right of the screen and select your TV from the list to cast to.
