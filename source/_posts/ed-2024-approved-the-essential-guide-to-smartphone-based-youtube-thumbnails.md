## The Essential Guide to Smartphone-Based YouTube Thumbnails

As a content creator, you know the importance of a visually appealing thumbnail for YouTube videos. It gives your viewers a sneak peek of what they can expect from your video and helps it stand out in the crowded world of YouTube.

When creating your thumbnail, it's important to remember that the recommended size is 1280 x 720 pixels and a minimum width of 640 pixels. With these dimensions in mind, let's dive into how you can easily create stunning thumbnails for your YouTube videos using your mobile phone.

## Method 1\. Make a YouTube Thumbnail on iPhone With the iPhone Photos App

One way to create a thumbnail for your YouTube video on your iPhone is to use the built-in Photos app. The Photos app comes pre-installed on all iPhones and offers a range of editing tools you can use to create a thumbnail.

The Photos app on your iPhone offers a range of features that you can use to create a custom thumbnail for your YouTube video. Here are some of the features you can use:

* **Crop:** The crop tool allows you to resize and reposition your thumbnail image by trimming away any unnecessary parts of the image.
* **Rotate:** The rotate tool lets you adjust the orientation of your thumbnail image. You can rotate the image clockwise or counterclockwise to achieve the desired angle.
* **Adjust lighting and color:** The lighting and color tools allow you to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and other aspects of the thumbnail image to enhance its overall appearance.
* **Add text:** You can use the text tool to add words or phrases to your thumbnail image. This can be a great way to include a call-to-action or to highlight a key feature of your video.
* **Add filters and stickers:** The Photos app includes a range of filters and stickers that you can use to give your thumbnail image a unique look. You can experiment with filters and stickers to find the perfect one for your thumbnail.

To create a thumbnail using the Photos app on your iPhone, follow these steps:

Step1 Open the Photos app and find the image you want to use as your thumbnail. **Tap** on the image to open it.

![ios photo app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-photo-app.jpg)

 Pros

* Convenient
* Easy to use
* Versatile

 Cons

* Limited customization option
* Lower image quality

This method is best for users looking for a quick and easy way to create a thumbnail on the go and doesn't need many customization options. It's also a good option for users needing computer or graphic design software access. If you're looking for more advanced customization options or higher image quality, consider using other methods or software.

## Method 2\. Make YouTube Thumbnails on Android/iPhone With Third-Party Apps

In addition to using the built-in Photos app on your iPhone or Android device, there are also many third-party apps that you can use to create YouTube thumbnails. Some popular options include Canva, Adobe Spark, and FotoJet. These apps offer a wider range of customization options and design templates, making it easy to create professional-looking thumbnails even if you have yet to gain graphic design experience.

One popular third-party app for creating YouTube thumbnails on both iPhone and Android devices is PixelLab. PixelLab is a powerful graphic design app with many features and tools for creating custom thumbnails. With PixelLab, you can add text, shapes, and stickers to your thumbnail image and adjust the image's color, lighting, and other aspects to get the perfect look. You can also import your images or graphics for your thumbnail design.

Here are the steps to create a thumbnail using PixelLab on your Android or iOS device:

Step1 Open the Play Store and **search** for PixelLab. **Install** the app.

![pixellab install](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pixellab-install.jpg)

If you're looking for a quick and easy way to create a thumbnail and only need a few customization options, consider using the built-in Photos app or other simpler methods.
