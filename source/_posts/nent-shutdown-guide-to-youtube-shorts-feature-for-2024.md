So friends, try this to avoid seeing YouTube Shorts videos either from phone or desktop. This is not only simple but also device-free. And even if you do not have a YouTube application, you can use this trick to solve your concern.

When you click on the **Uninstall** option, the YouTube version will get downgraded to the factory version. This is the version that is a pre-installed version of YouTube that comes with the device.

Also, if you have not updated your YouTube app, then don’t go with that. However, you will receive notifications many times that you should update your application. Just ignore it, especially if you are not willing to add the Shorts video option on your YouTube application.
