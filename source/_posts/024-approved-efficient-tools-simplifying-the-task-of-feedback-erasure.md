YouTube is a video platform where people share informative and entertaining content. It works in the form of channels belonging to individuals or companies. People can subscribe to these channels to show support, and YouTubers create a strong sense of community with these subscribers.

But some people comment inappropriate comments that can cause the community harm and spread hatred. Many YouTubers may want to delete such remarks. There are also times when you accidentally comment on a channel’s comment section and may wish to delete it.

So how do you delete all YouTube comments? In this how-to blog, we will show you.

## How to Delete YouTube Comments from Desktop?

In this section, we will tell you how you can do it from your desktop.

1. Go to [https://www.youtube.com/](https://www.youtube.com/) from your desktop browser and log in.
2. Once you log in, you need to go to your channel. For this, you can select the My Channel option from the upper-left side of your YouTube home page.
3. From the list of your videos, select the one you need and scroll down to reach the comment you want to delete.
4. When you locate the comment, click on the three vertical dots on the right-hand side of the comment. From the drop-down list, click on Remove. The process is complete, and YouTube will remove your comment.

You also have the option to report the comment or [hide the user from your channel](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## How to Delete All YouTube Comments from Mobile?

The steps to deleting someone else’s YouTube comments from your mobile are similar to those from your desktop.

1. Log in to your account from the YouTube app on your phone.
2. On the right-hand side of your YouTube homepage, there will be a profile icon. Tap on that, and from the list, select My Channel. This will direct you to all videos on your channel.
3. Select the video from where you want to delete a comment. Scroll down to reach the desired comment.
4. Once you reach the target comment, click on the three vertical dots at the bottom corner. There should be an option called Remove. Tap on it.
5. This will create another dialog box on the mobile app where you have to click on Remove again to delete the comment.

## How Do You Delete Your Comments from YouTube?

Fear not. Read on to know how to **delete all comments you posted on someone else’s YouTube channel** from your desktop.

1. Visit [https://www.youtube.com/](https://www.youtube.com/) from your desktop and then sign in YouTube channel.
2. If your YouTube account is not open, tap on Sign in and enter your email and password to log in to your account.

## How Do You Delete Your Comments from Your Phone?

Don’t have a desktop handy? This section will tell you how you can delete your comments you posted on your or someone else’s YouTube video from your mobile.

1. Go to the YouTube app on your phone. You will need to log in to your account to delete any comment you posted.
2. When the login process is complete, you need to find the video where your target comment is.

If it is someone else’s video, you can search for it by clicking on the magnifying glass at the top of the homepage or check your YouTube History to find it. To access your History, you need to click on an option called Library at the bottom of the homepage. From there, you can find the History option.

If it is your video where the comment to be removed is, you can go to My Channel from the profile icon on the right-hand side of the YouTube app’s homepage.

1. Once you locate the video, you need to find the comment you want to delete. On the YouTube app, you may need to scroll down for a while to do this.
2. When you reach it, click on the three vertical dots at the bottom corner of your comment. You should see an option called Delete. Click on that. You need to confirm once more that you want to delete it, and the process will be complete.

## Delete Other People’s Comments on Others’ Channels

Did you see a hate comment on your favorite creator’s video? Sadly, you cannot delete the comment. But, you can report it, and YouTube will hide or take it down.

You can do this both from your desktop or your phone with some easy steps.

**How to report people’s comments** **on YouTube?**

Go to <https://www.youtube.com/> from your desktop or open the YouTube app from your phone. Log in to your account if it is not open.

1. The next step is to find the video where the comment is. You can search for it by tapping on the search button at the top of the YouTube homepage. Or you can locate it from your YouTube History.

To find your History from your desktop, you need to click on the three horizontal lines at the top left corner of the homepage. You will find the History option from the list. To access it from your phone, click on the Library option at the bottom of your homepage, and it will open a list where you will find the History option.

1. Open the video, and scroll down to locate the comment you want to report.
2. Once you find your target comment, click on the three vertical dots that appear on its right side. You will find the Report option from the pop-up menu. Click on that.
3. When you tap Report, another dialogue box will appear. From the list of options, choose the most appropriate option, tap on Report at the lower right corner of the pop-up, and complete the process. YouTube will do the rest.
