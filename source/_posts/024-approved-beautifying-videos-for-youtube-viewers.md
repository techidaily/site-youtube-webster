Brightness settings can be used to adjust the overall look of your video. In case your video seems to be too dark or bright, you can take the cursor to the slider and adjust the color manually.

Saturation helps you control how much you want the color of your video pop out. The color can be faded or enhanced through this setting.

Contrast settings help to adjust the difference in color and brightness in different parts of the video.

**Color grading with Wondershare Filmora**

Hit the button Advanced at the lower corner, then a powerful color grading window will pop up, and you can explore your options.
