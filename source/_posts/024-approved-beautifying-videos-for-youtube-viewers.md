Saturation helps you control how much you want the color of your video pop out. The color can be faded or enhanced through this setting.

Contrast settings help to adjust the difference in color and brightness in different parts of the video.

Hit the button Advanced at the lower corner, then a powerful color grading window will pop up, and you can explore your options.
