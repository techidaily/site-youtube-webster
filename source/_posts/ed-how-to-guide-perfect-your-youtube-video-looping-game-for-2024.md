To loop YouTube videos using the In-built loop technique on iPhone, the procedure isn’t much different from that of a computer. Here are the steps;

### Option 2: Using playlist to set video loop

To play two YouTube videos at once, this is the method to use. Before you can begin the process of setting videos on repeat, you have to sign in first.

**Step 1:** Select the videos to play on repeat.

**Step 2:** Sign in to your YouTube.

**Step 3:** After signing in to YouTube, click the “**+**” icon at the bottom of the video. Select the “create new playlist” to add the chosen videos. Name your playlist and choose to view public or private.

### Option 3: Editing URL

This is among the least known method of creating a video loop. It involves editing the video URL of YouTube to replay. URL is usually divided in to different sections. This is the simplest option as involves only deleting the hypertext transfer protocol (https) and the World Wide Web (www) and inserting the word “repeat” immediately after “Youtube”.

This is how to do it:

**Step 1:** Search for the video to set on replay.

In our case, let’s choose - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc>

**Step 2:** Delete the first part “**<https://www.**”> in the address bar.

The remaining sections will be- youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc

**Step 3:** After “Youtube” and before “.com” write “repeat”.

So it looks like this “youtube**repeat**.com/watch/?v=xo1VInw-SKc” in your address bar.

**Step 4:** Click to play and your video will start playing in a loop in the ListenOnRepeat app.

![How to Loop YouTube Video: for Both Computer and Phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-loop-youtube-video-edit-url.jpg)
