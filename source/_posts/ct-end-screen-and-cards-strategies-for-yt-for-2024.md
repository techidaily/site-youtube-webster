YouTube Cards is more interactive. Users can add images and other linkes. Here are the steps.

* Click on the "Video Manager" tab.
* If you want to add cards, Click "Edit" tab under it. Then click “cards”.
* Choose the cards type you want to make on "Add Card" drop down menu.
* Click “create” button. Select the timeline. In the end, apply.

### The types of YouTube cards

* **Video or playlist**: links to other videos/the complete palylist on YouTube related or non-related to that specific videolinks to further purchase websites or specific product.
* **Channel**: promote another YouTube channel, one of the most common methods to collaborate with other YouTubers
* **Poll**: Encourage viewers to participate in a poll (vote)
* **Link**: links to a website which compliments whatever content is in the video.

### 4 Tips for Using YouTube Cards

**1\.** You might be used to pointing to the part of your screen where you intend to put an annotation, but when you use YouTube Cards they might switch locations depending on what device a viewer is watching on.

**2.** Use three or less cards per video. Viewers are more likely to click your cards if there are fewer of them, and more likely to start ignoring them if it seems like they’re always popping up. Also, do not have all three of these cards appear at once and make people choose between them. Stagger them throughout your video.

**3.** Your cards should be related to what you are saying in your vlog. Avoid posting completely random links in the middle of your video because a viewer who clicks on them will get confused. You can post any type of link you want at the very end of your video, though.

 **4.** The end of your video is always a great place to link viewers to another of your videos, whether you use a card or an end screen. If somebody liked your video enough to watch until the end they’ll probably welcome a chance to consume similar content.
