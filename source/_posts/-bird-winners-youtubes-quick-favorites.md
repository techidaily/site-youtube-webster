In the video, the superstar septet — Jin, Jimin, V, Jung Kook, J-Hope, Suga, and RM — appear in black-and-white, and they are wearing slick suits before it changes to color. They are rapping, singing, and dancing, with each one taking a turn to groove in an elevator. They also dance in a gymnasium and appear together on stage under pulsating lights.

This upbeat disco-pop track has soul and funk elements inspired by the Seventies and Eighties. And this theme echoes in the vintage-inspired outfits the members are wearing and the nostalgic settings in the music video.

In the background, viewers will see a warmly-lit record store and poster-studded bedroom that has tributes to The Beatles and David Bowie. The choreography includes shoutouts to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley and easy-to-follow freestyle dance moves that correspond well with the music.

With 108 million views in one day, Butter by BTS is undoubtedly the video with the most YouTube views in 24 hours. It is also the fastest YouTube video, as it reached 30 million views in 2 hours 20 minutes.

In the video, the superstar septet — Jin, Jimin, V, Jung Kook, J-Hope, Suga, and RM — appear in black-and-white, and they are wearing slick suits before it changes to color. They are rapping, singing, and dancing, with each one taking a turn to groove in an elevator. They also dance in a gymnasium and appear together on stage under pulsating lights.

#### 2) Dynamite - BTS

Released on August 21, 2020, Dynamite by BTS hit 101.1 million views in 24 hours. That makes it the second most watched YouTube video in 24 hours. This upbeat disco-pop track has soul and funk elements inspired by the Seventies and Eighties. And this theme echoes in the vintage-inspired outfits the members are wearing and the nostalgic settings in the music video.

In the background, viewers will see a warmly-lit record store and poster-studded bedroom that has tributes to The Beatles and David Bowie. The choreography includes shoutouts to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley and easy-to-follow freestyle dance moves that correspond well with the music.

#### 3) How You Like That - Blackpink

How You Like That is one of the videos that had the most views in 24 hours YouTube, as it managed to get 86.3 million views in 24 hours.

#### 4) Ice Cream - Black Wink Ft Selena Gomez

Ice Cream by Blackpink and Selena Gomez is another video with the most YouTube views in 24 hours. It hit 79 million views on YouTube in 24 hours.

The video shows Blackpink and Gomes in several colorful outfits and sets. It starts with the scene of Gomez wearing a candy-striped bikini with a white sailor hat and gold hoop earrings; she is driving an ice cream truck packed with Serendipity Ice Cream.

For the second post-chorus, the quartet appears in a pink ice cream parlor, and they are wearing black-and-white outfits and holding ice cream.

#### 5) BTS and Halsey’s Boy With Luv

Boy With Luv had hit 74.6 million views on YouTube within 24 hours of its release. When the music video was released in 2019, it became the fastest-viewed and liked YouTube video, reaching 3 million likes in just 2 hours.

#### 9) Nain Bengali - Guru Randhawa

Nain Bengali is the first Indian music video to earn 71.4 million views on YouTube within 24 hours of its release. The music video shows Randhawa in a chick look.

The video is set in a chrysalis, and it opens with a scene of a snake slithering on a floor; it explodes into colorful butterflies to show the end of Taylor's previous era. The video pans up to Urie and Taylor engaging in an argument. Taylor is donning a beautiful black and white tule dress that has floral accents.
