This upbeat disco-pop track has soul and funk elements inspired by the Seventies and Eighties. And this theme echoes in the vintage-inspired outfits the members are wearing and the nostalgic settings in the music video.

In the background, viewers will see a warmly-lit record store and poster-studded bedroom that has tributes to The Beatles and David Bowie. The choreography includes shoutouts to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley and easy-to-follow freestyle dance moves that correspond well with the music.

#### 3) How You Like That - Blackpink
