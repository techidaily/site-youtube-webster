## Part 1: Why are Vlog Channel Names Important?

Your Channel Name appears on your channel page, videos, and in YouTube's search results.

Just like a boring title, a generic vlog channel name will not last in the viewer's memory, precisely when there's so much competition vying for their YouTube engagement and attention. However, using attention-grabbing, punchy words can make for an entertaining YouTube channel name for vloggers. Remember, if your YouTube channel becomes successful, this will be the name that everyone knows you.

## Part 2: What to Consider Before Picking YouTube channel names for Vloggers?

Selecting a vlog channel name might not be simple as it seems. There are multiple options out there, so how will you know if you've chosen the right one?

To help you decide better, we've designed a step-by-step guide that shows you exactly how to develop some excellent **vlog channel name ideas**.

**Step 1: Consider the Image You Want to Portray**

Vlog channel names often highlight the brand or person on the other end. While not the case for all, you will notice how many define their overall objective or mission. This can be ideal to begin when thinking of new Youtube channel names for vloggers. Don't pretend to be someone you're not when you select your vlog channel name.

It's pretty vital that you, the channel owner, portray a message or an image that feels natural and provides your audience with an opportunity for best relation and recognition.

**Step 2: Stay Consistent with Your YouTube Niche**

The name you select must also reflect the niche upon which you based your channel. If you have a new channel, it can be hard to compete with more prominent vlog channels that cover important content topics. That's why you should try to be particular and become the best at designing topics for the subject you've selected.

While you may get required exposure with a random name to grow your channel, it's better, to begin with, something focal to the point.

**Step 3: Get a Feel for Your Target Audience**

Your target audience could be a huge factor in selecting the best name for a vlogging channel. Also, consider other vlog channels in the niche you've chosen and read through their video comments. Search out what your audience likes and vice versa. A precise scenario of your audience's interests will allow you to choose the best name for a vlogging channel.

**Step 4: Keep Your Channel Name Short**

A YouTube channel name, or username, is max up to 60 characters, but generally, you get nowhere near that! Long channel names are not essential and can also be confusing to the viewers. They can also be tough to replicate or spell while searching. A concise, short username for your YouTube vlog channel can also give you the image of having more authority.

**Step 5: Make Your Channel Name Memorable**

Remember, if your YouTube vlog channel namebecomes excellent, this will be the name that everyone knows you by. It will be there with your videos, your playlists, and thumbnails. You don't want a bad image that drags you downwards, but add creative writing tools like word plays, abbreviations, sibilance, alliteration, and puns to increase memorability.
