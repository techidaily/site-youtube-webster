Whether you need YouTube icons and logos to use as pop-up graphics in your videos, to serve as your channel icon, to use as watermarks, or to liven up your channel art or video thumbnails – don’t worry. There are lots of places to get them.

We’ve made a list of 6 sites where you can download icons and logos for free for YouTub videos, and explained how they work.

> * [Flaticon.com](#flaticon)
> * [Freepik.com](#freepik)
> * [Seeklogo.net](#seeklogo)
> * [IconArchive.com](#iconarchive)
> * [Logaster.com](#logaster)
> * [Icons8.com](#icons8)

You might also want to check out these YouTube channels offering free [profile picture templates](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html).

## 1\. [Flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Great selection of icons/logos_
> * _It's easy to change the colors before you download_

I’m putting Flaticon.com right at the top of this list because it has something that really sets it apart from the other sites on this list – it lets you edit pre-made icons before you download them.

You start out on Flaticon by searching for a theme like beauty, gaming, flowers, or emojis. I searched for ‘birds’ and found these cuties.

![ YouTube Logo Icon Download Site Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg)

_These aren’t all the birds on Flaticon, just a few._ _They had a huge selection in all the different searches I tried._

I clicked on the brown bird to open up the download screen, and then clicked into ‘Edit icon’. There may be a pop up that tells you editing tools are only available to registered users, but it’s wrong. Just close it and keep going, unless you want to register.

![  Logo Icon on Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-flaticon-example-1.jpg)

You can edit the colors in your icon just by clicking on the color you want to replace, and then clicking on the color in the color selector you want to replace it with. I made my birdie FLY.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ Edit Logo Icon on Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg)

_I never apologize for puns._

Once you like the look of your icon, just click Download. You will be prompted to choose a format. PNG is the most popular because it is supported the most places (including on YouTube), and because it allows for a transparent background.

After clicking on a format you will also be prompted to choose a size for your image. It’s always best to go with the largest image you can – its way easier to shrink things and keep them looking good than it is to have to enlarge them.

![ download Logo Icon on Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg)

Flaticon has a great selection, it’s free, and they make it really easy to edit your creations. I would strongly recommend this site to anyone in the market for an icon or logo.

Flaticon asks that you include an “Icon made by \[author link\] from <www.flaticon.com> ” somewhere (i.e. video description, channel ‘about’ section) when you use their icons for free.

## 2\. [Freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Good selection of icons._
> * _No way to customise them on the site._
> * _Attribution requried._

On freepik, you start off by searching for a theme (like the genre of your YouTube title or the topic of a video, i.e. ‘makeup’ or ‘music’). I searched for ‘cat’.

![ download Logo Icon on Freepik](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-freepik.jpg)

_A few of the sets available on freepik. The crown icon means you need to be a paying Premium member, but most things are free._

You can’t edit on freepik, and in order to download for free you need to include an attribution/credit to freepik where you use the images.

You do not choose what format to download your images in on freepik. When you hit ‘Free Download’ it will automatically download a zip file which will contain both a .jpg and a .eps. The EPS is editable in any ‘vector graphics editor’, like Adobe Illustrator, and YouTube supports .jpg files.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. [Seeklogo.net](https://www.seeklogo.net/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Logos from major brands_
> * _Great for channels that do product reviews_

Seeklogo.net has a slightly more corporate slant than some of the other sites on this list. It has logos for a lot of major companies and brands available for download.

In the ‘search’ on Seeklogo.net, you can type in the name of a brand or industry and see if the well-known logo you’re looking for is available. This may be especially useful for people with sports related channels since they have a lot of logos for major teams.

I searched for YouTube – you never know when you might need the YouTube logo.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ YouTube Logo Icon on Seeklogo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-icons-logos-on-seeklogo.jpg)

Although the site does not advertise PNG in the list of formats on their front page, downloads do include PNG versions (which is useful if you need transparency and don’t have a program which can edit vector files, like .eps).

## 4\. [IconArchive.com](http://www.iconarchive.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Site has an office/business slant._
> * _Detailed search tool lets you sort by color, theme, etc._

IconArchive has a huge selection of icons with somewhat of an office/business slant. I searched for ‘flower’ and half the results were of file-folders with flowers on them.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on IconArchive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-iconarchive.jpg)

_Could be cool for a lifestyle video about school or work?_

My favorite thing about IconArchive is its search features. It allows you to filter results by color, size (down to the specific resolution), category, background color, style, and a lot more.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on IconArchive Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-icons-logos-on-iconarchive.jpg)

Color is under ‘Display’, meaning that it won’t filter out results that have different colors it’ll just list the color you select first.

The ‘Category’ filter is useful because there are some genres you probably recognize there, like ‘Lifestyle’. However, you should be careful not to over-filter. This site is pretty literal in how it categorizes. For example – there are no ‘flower’ images under ‘Lifestyle’.

Downloads are available in different sizes and formats including PNG. PNG is always a good option because it is supported by YouTube and includes transparent backgrounds.

Note that all of your different download buttons will be located underneath your image. They favor those ads that look like ‘download’ or ‘start now’ buttons, and the ads sit right next to the images on the right, so it’s easy to get confused and click on the ad.

## 5\. [Logaster.com](https://www.logaster.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _You'll have to pay for larger images._
> * _Focused more on businesses._
> * _Incorporates your channel name._

Logaster is really a service for businesses – they make and sell business cards, letterheads, and other office-y things like that. However, they are still a good choice for YouTubers because they have a free logo creator. Sort of.

You actually have to pay $9.99 to get larger images and remove the watermark, but the process is free.

When you arrive on Logaster there’s a button right on their home page that says ‘Create a logo for free’. Click on it.

In Step 1 it’ll ask for your company name and an activity type. You just need to put in your channel name and choose something from the activity drop down that you focus on in your videos.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on Logaster Start Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/branding-icons-logos-on-logaster.jpg)

My heart burns with the secret desire to be YouTube’s Neil Degrasse Tyson (it doesn’t really, but he is super cool) so I tried ‘Katie Does Science’ and ‘Science, Studies, Education’. Here’s what it came up with:

![ YouTube Logo Icon on Logaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/branding-icons-logos-suggestions-on-logaster.jpg)

_There are 10 pages of suggestions!_

You can see how, unless you have a short channel name, you’re probably not going to be able to use any of these as an icon, but a lot of them would look cool on a banner. There’s an ‘Edit Logo Concept’ button which allows you to make changes to the layout, but you can still only choose from preset layouts. For example, some logo concepts allow you to choose whether the icon is above your text or next to it.

After you click ‘save’ in the last step you’ll be prompted to provide an email address and password. Once you sign in, you’ll be able to download a small logo for free, or purchase the higher resolution image.

I personally wouldn’t recommend buying an image from here unless your channel is for your small business and you need things like branded business cards and letterhead. This site might be better for gathering inspiration than actually downloading a logo from.

## 6\. [Icons8.com](https://icons8.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _You need to link back to them to use their icons._
> * _You can edit the colors on the site and even add details._
> * _There's a size limit on the free service (100x100px)_

At Icons8 they have free and paid services. If you download an icon for free it will be a PNG file (which should be fine, YouTube supports PNG and it’s good for transparency) that is no larger than 100x100px. This is not ideal since YouTube recommends 800x800px for profile pictures, but it’s not necessarily a deal breaker either. Profile pictures render down to much smaller than that.

You will also need to link to Icons8 if you use their icons for free (i.e. in the ‘about’ section of your channel page).

To get started on Icons8, type something into the search bar on the home page that you think might work as an icon or as part of whatever graphics you have planned. I typed in ‘game’ for this one, since gaming is the biggest genre on YouTube. Here are a few of the results that came up:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ Gaming Logo Icon on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg)

_Lower down in the results there were different kinds of sports balls, hand-held gaming systems, playing cards, joy sticks, baseball caps and more._

After you find an icon you like, click on it and it will appear on the right side of your screen where you’ll be able to make a few changes (an editing screen will pop up once you start clicking on things). You can edit your colors, overlay small decals, add text, and add a border, change your background and adjust your size. Here’s the editing screen:

![ Edit Gaming Logo Icon on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg)

You can give your icon a pretty different look from its default. Check this out:

![ Change Gaming Logo Icon background on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gaming-icons-logos-background-on-icons8.jpg)

You cannot download your icon from the editing screen. You need to click Save, and then download it from the main display screen here:

![ Donwload Gaming Logo Icon  on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg)

You can change the size with that drop down menu, but you’ll be limited in your options if you don’t want to pay.

I downloaded my image and tried to see how it would look as an icon/profile picture. As you can see, it was pretty blurry in the preview:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397" border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ Add Gaming Logo Icon made with icons8 to YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-gaming-icons-logos-made-with-icons8.jpg)

However, the preview is larger than the actual profile picture. Once I set it, it looked alright.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
