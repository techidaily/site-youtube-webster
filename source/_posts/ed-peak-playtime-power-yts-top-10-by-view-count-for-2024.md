## Top 10 Most Watched YouTube Video in 24 Hours

Music videos get the most views in 24 hours YouTube because fans of these artists can repeatedly play the songs. Here are ten YouTube videos that had the most views in a day.

#### 1) Butter - BTS

With 108 million views in one day, Butter by BTS is undoubtedly the video with the most YouTube views in 24 hours. It is also the fastest YouTube video, as it reached 30 million views in 2 hours 20 minutes.

In the video, the superstar septet — Jin, Jimin, V, Jung Kook, J-Hope, Suga, and RM — appear in black-and-white, and they are wearing slick suits before it changes to color. They are rapping, singing, and dancing, with each one taking a turn to groove in an elevator. They also dance in a gymnasium and appear together on stage under pulsating lights.

#### 2) Dynamite - BTS

Released on August 21, 2020, Dynamite by BTS hit 101.1 million views in 24 hours. That makes it the second most watched YouTube video in 24 hours. This upbeat disco-pop track has soul and funk elements inspired by the Seventies and Eighties. And this theme echoes in the vintage-inspired outfits the members are wearing and the nostalgic settings in the music video.

In the background, viewers will see a warmly-lit record store and poster-studded bedroom that has tributes to The Beatles and David Bowie. The choreography includes shoutouts to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley and easy-to-follow freestyle dance moves that correspond well with the music.

#### 3) How You Like That - Blackpink

How You Like That is one of the videos that had the most views in 24 hours YouTube, as it managed to get 86.3 million views in 24 hours.
