A loop video is a short video that plays in repeat/ indefinitely. Loop videos can be created with features on social media apps and third-party apps.

iPhone has a setting that allows you to edit the photos to loop or bounce videos, and it only works with a photo feature called 'live photo'. The live photo feature records 1.5 seconds moving picture when you click on the shutter button.

The live photo feature can be edited to create a loop video, and you can do that by following these steps:

To do this, capture a live photo by opening your camera app. Then click on the live photo icon, which is located in the upper right corner. And tap on the shutter button.

1. Afterward, you locate the live photo you want to convert to a loop video by going to the Photos apps. Then click on _Albums > Media Types> Live photos._

![iPhone live photos options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-live-photos-options.jpg)
