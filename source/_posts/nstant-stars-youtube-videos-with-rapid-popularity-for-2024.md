Interaction with your audience also builds a strong following. You can nurture a community by responding to comments, particularly if one of the viewers asks a direct question. Other viewers will most likely comment on your videos when they are sure you will respond.

Let the followers on your other social channels know every time you upload new video on your YouTube channel. You use a short teaser video to do this.
