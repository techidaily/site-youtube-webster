### Option 3: Editing URL

This is among the least known method of creating a video loop. It involves editing the video URL of YouTube to replay. URL is usually divided in to different sections. This is the simplest option as involves only deleting the hypertext transfer protocol (https) and the World Wide Web (www) and inserting the word “repeat” immediately after “Youtube”.

This is how to do it:

**Step 1:** Search for the video to set on replay.

In our case, let’s choose - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc>

**Step 2:** Delete the first part “**<https://www.**”> in the address bar.

The remaining sections will be- youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc

**Step 3:** After “Youtube” and before “.com” write “repeat”.

So it looks like this “youtube**repeat**.com/watch/?v=xo1VInw-SKc” in your address bar.

**Step 4:** Click to play and your video will start playing in a loop in the ListenOnRepeat app.

This app will make you glued to the computer with infinite loops on the best part of the YouTube video. Whether you want to watch the full video on repeat or a specific part, the infinite loop should be your choice.

However, this is not a to- go-for app if you intend to watch the video later without spending a single byte. To solve this problem, use a video downloader and with [**Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) edit the video as much as you want then save it to your library.

It’s not common to be attracted to only one video. InfiniteLooper designers never thought of this. You have to use other technologies to play two YouTube videos at once.
