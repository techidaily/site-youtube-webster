## How to Edit YouTube Videos on Your Android Smartphone?

With the YouTube app, android users have an easy way to grab and upload videos to YouTube directly from their mobile devices.

Simply hit on the video camera button, record the clip and the app will upload your recording to your YouTube channel on the background. It also makes it possible to select existing videos from your SD card and upload them directly to your channel.

In some instances, you may want to edit your videos on android devices. With the YouTube android app, editing videos is a simple task which involves the following process-:

Step 1: Click on YouTube and choose the small little icon indicating your profile. This will reveal to you all your videos on YouTube.

Step 2: Locate the video you want to edit then click on the three vertical little dots on the far right of the video to reveal for you more options. Choose on the “Edit” button drop-down menu.

Step 3: Once done with the editing, click on the small little icon (looks like a forward arrow) at the top of the screen to save your edits.

The video will load again and you will receive an on-screen message telling you that the video has been updated.
