The 6D is also equipped with the same 45-point all cross-phase detection and dual pixel CMOS autofocusing system as the 80D. If you’re wanting to vlog with a full-frame camera, the 6D Mark II is the best option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
