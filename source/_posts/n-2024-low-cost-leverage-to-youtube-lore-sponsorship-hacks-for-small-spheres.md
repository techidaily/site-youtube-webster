### 1\. Read YouTube Rules

As you are a small channel, you must be very cautious about the YouTube rules. Never put up any abusive content on your channel that degrades the value of YouTube. Ensure that your channel’s content fits the directions and guidelines of YouTube.

The supporters of **YouTube sponsorship** for small channels would never wish to get associated with channels that might be erased due to the strategy infringement of YouTube. So, be careful before uploading your content.

### 2\. Quality Content Is Important

The content you offer through your channel must offer valuable content. Not just that, you must have a library of valuable content so that the potential sponsors can browse through several materials in your channel.

### 3\. Leave Your Business Email

Always add a business email ID to your channel, which shows that you would love to receive business inquiries. This is the ID where you will receive notifications for friend requests, video comments, and even the battering messages once you have a large fan following.

### 2\. Reach Out Directly

Reaching out to the people directly is one of the tried and tested ways to acquire YouTube sponsorship for small channels. Research and try to find 50 to 100 companies that would be interested in your channel.

It is essential to make yourself stand out in the colossal crowd. Ensure your channel is unique and somewhat different from the rest because the contacted companies keep receiving partnering submissions from several other content creators too.

One important thing is not to send out the same old letter to all 50 companies and keep hoping to receive a positive response from at least one. Try to focus on your channel’s USP and highlight the same in your letter to the companies while trying to contact the companies for YouTube Sponsorship.

## Part 3: Types of Sponsorship

#### 1\. Product Sponsorships

When you are searching for sponsorship for a particular product, ensure that it is relevant to your channel. Never approach the sponsors without ensuring the same as you might put off your viewers and your sponsors will not achieve their expected results. You might lose both your sponsors and audiences in such a case.

When you try to get YouTube sponsorship for small channels, it is quite difficult as the promotion of the product becomes limited to whatever small following they have. Product reviews and tutorials are the best ways to obtain product sponsorships.

### 2\. Paid Sponsorship

Among all sponsorships, paid sponsorship is the most challenging one. Usually, when you review the products of the affiliate links in your videos, you earn revenues, but, in the paid sponsorship you earn by advertising product and company links on your channel.

When you add the company’s products to your videos, you earn money. It appears at the beginning and at the end of your videos after it is played on your YouTube channel.

### 3\. Affiliate Sponsorship

It is the easiest of all sponsorships but also the least revenue-generating one too. Affiliate sponsorship works by sharing affiliate codes and links. It is used by your audiences to obtain discounts or offer you a reward.

There are two types in which affiliate sponsorship works. One is the discounting option where the code is shared and the viewers use these codes to get discounts anywhere between 5-15% in shopping products from that same site. Another option is to use the affiliate code to integrate it into an URL that offers profits to a content creator in form of traffic.
