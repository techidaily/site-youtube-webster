**New Release Mix:** In the New Release Mix playlist, you can find all the newest tracks from your favorite artists, and some music is recommended. New updates are provided every Friday (when most new releases come out), and mid-week releases the entire week to ensure you're always up-to-date on the latest music.

The YouTube Music Replay Mix playlist is located on the home screen of the YouTube Music app and website under the **"Mixed for you"** header. Here you can also find other playlists, including **"Your likes," "New Release Mix," "My Supermix,"** and **"Discover Mix."**

* Launch YouTube Music app on your mobile device or head to its website on your computer.

### 6\. Are YouTube Mixes Endless?

YouTube Music offers an endless personalized music playlist called **"My Mixes."** Every time you click or tap the playlist, a new queue of your most listened or favorite tracks is generated for you.

The playlist contains about 100 songs with an endless auto-play feature once you reach the end of the list.
