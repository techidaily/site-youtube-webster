#### \- Actively Engage with Your Followers

Because YouTube's algorithm heavily bases its rankings on clicks and comments, you need to engage with your audience and open the doors for more people to watch your video. Interaction with your audience also builds a strong following. You can nurture a community by responding to comments, particularly if one of the viewers asks a direct question. Other viewers will most likely comment on your videos when they are sure you will respond.

This upbeat disco-pop track has soul and funk elements inspired by the Seventies and Eighties. And this theme echoes in the vintage-inspired outfits the members are wearing and the nostalgic settings in the music video.

#### 9) Nain Bengali - Guru Randhawa

Nain Bengali is the first Indian music video to earn 71.4 million views on YouTube within 24 hours of its release. The music video shows Randhawa in a chick look.
