Taking viewers ‘in app’ is an effective way to show them how you work or play. A screen recording is a footage recorded not from your camera, but directly from the interface of your computer or mobile device. A screen recording might be footage from a game, a software tutorial, or a demonstration of your creative process in a program.

We have picked up the best 10 paid [screen recorders for YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on Windows and Mac, but if you are looking for a complete solution to record videos on Windows, Mac, Android or iOS phone to make tutorial videos, how-to videos, or demonstration videos, or products/software review videos, or gameplay videos on YouTube, here is the all the information you need. This article will introduce you to the best screen recorders on computers, Android devices, and iPhones for YouTube.

The recording window will pop up and you will be able to decide whether you want to record your full screen, a customized selection of it, or a specific target window. After you have finished recording your clip will automatically appear in the Media menu in your Filmora project so you can edit it right away.

#### 3.VLC Media Player \[Windows & Mac & Linux, Free\]

![screen recorder vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-recorder-VLC.JPG)

VLC Media Player is a free media player that has a great screen recording feature. You can download it from Video LAN.org. In order to take a screen recording using VLC you first need to click on View and Advanced Controls. A lot of the more advanced features, like screen recording, are initially hidden so as not to confuse users, but selecting Advanced Controls will make them visible. Then you can go to Media and Open Capture Device. In the window that opens choose Desktop next to Capture Mode and click Play. VLC will start displaying your desktop in the player window. Now you just have to click Record.

#### 4.QuickTime \[Mac, Free\]

![screen recorder quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-recorder-QuickTime.JPG)

QuickTime is the default media player for Mac users. To access QuickTime’s screen recording feature select File and New Screen Recording. In the window that pops up click on the arrow next to the Record button and choose a microphone. Then you can press Record. Your recording will not start right away. First, a window will pop up explaining that you can stop your recording by pressing ‘command-control-escape’. Although QuickTime is available for PCs the PC version does not have a screen recording feature.

QuickTime can be used to record the screen of your iPhone or iPad in addition to the screen of your Mac. First you need to connect your device to your computer with a USB port. Instead of selecting ‘New Screen Recording’ in QuickTime, the way you would when recording your computer screen, select ‘New Movie Recording’. In the recording window click on the arrow next to the ‘Record’ button and choose your iOS device where it asks you to choose a camera. This method only works with the Mac version of QuickTime.
