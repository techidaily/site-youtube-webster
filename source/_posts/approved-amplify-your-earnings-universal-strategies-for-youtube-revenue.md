YouTube Studio's new icon complements other YouTube apps more closely. YouTube TV and YouTube Music are two examples. App icons are also updated to improve visibility on mobile, especially in dark modes.

#### Appeals for mobile monetization

You can now appeal video monetization decisions within the app. You may disagree with their decisions, such as a yellow dollar icon instead of a green one. If appropriate, the appealed video's monetization status will be reviewed by a human policy specialist. Select the yellow $ icon and tap Request review on a video with limited monetization.

#### Revenue Metrics now support currency settings

The Revenue Metrics in Analytics can now be viewed in any currency. This makes it easier to balance revenue and payments. $USD was the only currency available for analytics. Right at the top of the page, tap your channel icon > Currency.

#### YouTube Studio Icons & App Icons

YouTube Studio's new icon complements other YouTube apps more closely. YouTube TV and YouTube Music are two examples. App icons are also updated to improve visibility on mobile, especially in dark modes.

#### Thе navigation bar at thе bottom

Navigation icons have been addеd to thе bottom of thе screen to makе switching between tabs еasiеr. A onе-tap intеrfacе allows usеrs to accеss Dashboards, Contеnt, Analytics, Commеnts, and Playlists. Rather than hiding icons behind a three-line menu in the top left corner.

#### New Edit Options

The bottom of your screen will show three options for editing the video once you've selected it. The following are among them:

* Trim your video's beginning or end with scissors
* The Wand lets you add color filters to your videos
* Make your video more engaging by adding a music track. The volume lеvеl of thе music can bе adjustеd by adjusting thе sliders nеxt to thе song title.

Compared to thе wеb vеrsion, thе mobile app has fеwеr editing options. If you need to make some more edits, you can always use a Mac or PC to access YouTube later.
