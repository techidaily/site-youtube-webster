You will require having permission from the owner especially if you intend to use it for commercial purposes. Otherwise, you will be infringing on their rights and can be liable for legal action.

YouTube is very strict on works that infringe copyrights and is quick to block or pull-down such videos.

It is possible for you to simply contact the owner of the video to ask for the permission with an explanation of the purpose.
