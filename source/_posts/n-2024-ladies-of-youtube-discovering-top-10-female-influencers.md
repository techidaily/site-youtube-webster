## Top 10 Female YouTubers

We've comprised this list based on the number of subscribers a channel has, and we excluded the VEVO channels. So let's see who are the top 10 female YouTubers in 2021

1. [JennaMarbles](#part1)
2. [Liza Koshy](#part2)
3. [RCLBeauty101](#part3)
4. [IISuperwomanII](#part4)
5. [Zoella](#part5)
6. [Wengie](#part6)
7. [Bethany Mota](#part7)
8. [Lindsey Stirling](#part8)
9. [Rosanna Pansino](#part9)
10. [Miranda Sings](#part10)

#### 1. [JennaMarbles](https://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles)

**Subscribers:** 18 million

Back in 2010, Jenna's video 'How to Trick People Into Thinking You're Good Looking' collected 5.3 million views in a single week. The type of humor that made her famous continues to be her signature mark eight years later.

Today, Jenna Nicole Mourey is the owner of the most popular channel on YouTube operated by a woman, and she is also the first social media star that has her wax figure in the Madame Tussauds museum. She made appearances on a number of TV shows and full feature movies, but their success can't be compared with the popularity of Jenna's YouTube videos.

#### 2. [Liza Koshy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxSz6JVYmzVhtkraHWZC7HQ)

**Subscribers:** 15 million

The charming and incredibly funny YouTuber Liza Koshy has become one of the platform's biggest stars in a relatively short period of time. She started her YouTube channel in 2013, and just a few years later, she interviewed the ex-US President Barack Obama.

Currently, Liza's channel has more than 1.5 billion views, and her videos frequently attract millions of viewers. Liza also has an acting career, and she is working on a new YouTube series called Liza on Demand. She is only 21, and it seems she is going to be one of the most popular female YouTubers for a long time.

#### 3. [RCLBeauty101](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB0d0JLn1WcGYcwwZ87d2LA)

**Subscribers:** 13 million

This young and talented YouTuber produces several different genres of videos. You can find beauty, comedy, DIY, or challenge videos on her channel, which has nearly 3 billion total views. Rachel Levin has been posting videos to her YouTube channel since 2010, and her most popular video up to date has 221 million views.

Beauty and fashion videos made Rachel famous, as she has been mentioned on more than one occasion in the articles published in Cosmopolitan and Forbes magazines. The 23-year old beauty guru continues to be one of YouTube's most influential ladies, and there is no reason to believe that this is going to change soon.

#### 4. [IISuperwomanII](https://www.youtube.com/user/IISuperwomanII)

**Subscribers:** 13 million

In addition to being one of the most influential women on YouTube, Lily Singh is also an actress, a singer, a writer, and a philanthropist. Lily posts vlogs on her second YouTube channel called [SuperwomanVlogs](https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperwomanVlogs), which has more than 2.2 million subscribers.

She frequently collaborates with superstars such as James Franco, Seth Rogen, Selena Gomez, or Steve Aoki. Lily's acting career is almost as successful as her YouTube channel because she starred in HBO's adaptation of 'Fahrenheit 451' and several TV shows. The IISuperwomanII channel has more than 2.6 billion views, and in 2017 Lilly landed 10th place on Forbes' list of highest-paid YouTube stars.

#### 5. [Zoella](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWRV5AVOlKJR1Flvgt310Cw)

**Subscribers:** 12 million

Zoe Elizabeth Sugg started her online career as a blogger in 2009, and the initial success of her blog inspired her to start her own YouTube channel that same year. Zoe mostly produces fashion and beauty videos, although you can find titles such as 'Ultimate Pizza Taste Challenge With Mark' or 'Draw My Life' on her channel as well.

In November 2014, Zoe released her first novel titled 'Girl Online' that sold a record number of copies in a single week. She won Cosmopolitan Blog Award, Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award, Teen Choice Award, and in 2016, she was nominated for the YouTuber of The Year Shorty Award.

#### 6. [Wengie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD9PZYV5heAevh9vrsYmt1g)

**Subscribers:** 11 million

Australia's most popular YouTuber is famous for fashion and beauty videos, although you can find DIY videos or pranks on her channel as well. The title of the track is inspired by her real name Wen Jie Huang, and she posts videos to [Wengie Vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/user/LifeOfWengie) and [Wengie Music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuBuvOo0l7S9Yf-RbrGScBQ) channels.

In 2017 Wen released a single 'Baby Believe Me' in China, which was followed by another track, 'Oh I Do', that gathered 7 million views. She works as a voice actress, and she was the voice of Blisstina's Bliss Utonium in Australian and New Zealand versions of The Power Puff Girls.

#### 7. [Bethany Mota](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6W7efUSkd9YYoxOnctlFg)

**Subscribers:** 10 million

Bethany's signature mark is the haul video. She has been producing them since the early 2010s. Her first video was uploaded to YouTube in 2009, and by 2015 her channel already had over 9 million subscribers. Mota's videos are mostly about fashion, and she often offers tips on how to look great for different occasions.

Her clothing, perfume, and accessories line was launched in collaboration with Aeropostale, and it is still a major success. Bethany appeared on several episodes of 'Dancing With The Stars' and she released a couple of singles that received a moderate amount of praise from the critics.

#### 8. [Lindsey Stirling](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyC%5F4jvPzLiSkJkLIkA7B8g)

**Subscribers:** 10 million

The world-famous violinist who started as a YouTuber in 2007 is one of the most influential women on the platform. You can find everything related to her music on her channel, including numerous collaborations with other artists.

She plays classical, electronic, pop, and rock music, and so far, she has released four studio albums. Lindsey has won the Billboard Music Award, YouTube Award as well as Shorty Award for her artistry, and at the age of 31, she remains to be one of YouTube's brightest stars.

#### 9. [Rosanna Pansino](https://www.youtube.com/user/RosannaPansino)

**Subscribers:** 10 million

Pansino started her channel because she wanted to get more comfortable in front of a camera while she was pursuing a career in acting. Eight years later, she is one of the most respected food YouTubers in the world and the author of the award-winning series Nerdy Nummies.

The series is a baking show dedicated to showing the viewers how to prepare nerdy-themed food. A bunch of YouTube celebrities appeared on the show, including Michelle Phan, Bethany Mota, and Lindsey Stirling. Pansino's YouTube channel has more than 75 million views per month, which makes her one of the most popular YouTubers in 2021.

#### 10. [Miranda Sings](https://www.youtube.com/user/mirandasings08/featured)

**Subscribers:** 8.9 million

Colleen Ballinger is an actress, a comedian, and most importantly, the creator of the fictional character Miranda Sings. Her videos are a satirical portrayal of musicians and singers who post videos to YouTube in the hope that they will be recognized by major record companies. Miranda lives with her mother and her uncle, and she is relentlessly ambitious, but her singing talents are next to non-existent.

Ballinger's character has almost a cult following as most of her videos have millions of views. Miranda is also the main protagonist of a Netflix series titled 'Haters Back Off' that was developed by Colleen and her brother Christopher.

**Conclusion:**

Some of the best videos on YouTube are produced by women, and it is hardly surprising that quite a few female YouTubers have over 10 million subscribers. The ladies we included in this article are famous for a reason, but there are many more we couldn't feature here. Who is your favorite female YouTuber? Leave a comment and let us know.
